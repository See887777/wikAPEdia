How to easily transfer shares from Fidelity to Computershare

Some Clarifying Information:

I have recently transferred a portion of my shares that I intend to hold forever to be Direct Registered in my name through Computershare and want to clarify the process for Fidelity customers. I was reading through many of the posts on reddit about the process of transferring to Computershare and how much of a nightmare it was despite all of the benefits that came with it, but my experience wasn't as bad as all of that. I am still testing some things out to get a better idea of the selling process, but for now I am going to focus on the transferring. Since I am unknowledgeable about how selling works, and from all the reviews online, I can't recommend anyone move shares they are planning on selling in a timely fashion into Computershare. Computershare seems to be stuck in the olden times when it comes to handling things, but I think it is that way by design. Computershare is not a broker, they are the Transfer Agent for GameStop as well as many other very large/reputable companies, and as the transfer agent everything must be more thorough and trackable. I have been able to do everything I needed to do online besides printing one form to sign and scan back into a pdf. They are not really equipped for fast retail customer service, I used their chat once in the process and it was hard to understand what they were trying to tell me, but eventually we came to an understanding. They usually deal with people who know the terminology, ins and outs, and paperwork involved in their process, like board members, brokers, lawyers, etc. The influx of retail investors they are having is probably overwhelming. I was called a shill and banned from [r/GMEJungle](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/) for talking about transferring shares because a user looked up their reviews on trustpilot and its all one star reviews so they called me a shill because Fidelity is great and no one knows who Computershare is(even though they are the company who is directly in charge of all shares of multiple well known and successful companies, including GameStop). So they asked that I be banned and I was with no clarification or response to my message questioning why I was banned for talking about transferring shares to the company that holds all of the Board of Directors shares. A remarkable amount of those one star reviews are from January of this year and after, and after reading through a lot of them they do not line up with my personal experience which is admittedly not very in depth yet. Basically I want to be as transparent as I can be with all of this. After the time I spent doing the research for myself and my position I am keeping all the shares I want to sell during the coming MOASS in my Fidelity Account. I am keeping all of my forever shares in my Computershare account. I am not telling anyone to do what I am doing or anything like that, I am simply documenting the process in case anyone wishes to hold their forever shares in the safest/most beneficial place, alongside Ryan Cohen, Matt Furlong, and myself. I am not a financial advisor, nor a cat. Im just an ape with more shares of a stock I like than I know what to do with.

[u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/) post I used to help me through my transfer. - <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step_by_step_method_for_direct_registering_shares/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3>

The process:

First, you DO NOT need an account with Computershare to begin the transfer. In fact you cannot setup an account until after you have successfully transferred into or bought a share through Computer share. Since Computershare is NOT a broker they cannot initiate the transfer. You must start the transfer through Fidelity. I talked with an agent and like [u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/) says in their post, they had no idea what I was talking about, but eventually we figured it out and it's actually quite simple if you have all the information ready. The second link has all the info you will need and more, and I will include all info that's not my personal info in each step as well. Here are the step by step instructions with all the info you need. You won't need to talk with an agent, but please do if you have any questions with the process as they are much better suited for answering your questions than I am.

Step 1: Go to Fidelity.com and look for the search bar in the top right

Step 2: Type in "transfer gift" in the search bar and clik the magnifying glass to search

Step 3: Find the form titled Transfer Shares as a Gift-Nonretirement (PDF) in the results and open it.

Step 4: You now have the form you need to fill out to initiate the transfer and it looks like this.

Step 5: Enter your Fidelity Account Number and the name on the account in the boxes marked for them. The form only lets you type in 8 characters and its a 9 character account#. To work around this simply write out your account number into Notepad and copy and paste it into the form. This issue has been brought to Fidelity's attention.

Step 6: Fill out the first part of section 2. This is very important to get right. I put N/A in the Receiving Firms Account Number because I did not have an account with them yet. I included the information Computershare needs for your account in the Additional Details box.

Step 7: Fill out the rest of Section 2. Investment name and CUSIP # will be as I entered for GME. The field for the CUSIP# on the form only lets you type 8 characters and the CUSIP# is 9 characters long. [u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/) pointed out a workaround where you type the full 9 character CUSIP# into notepad and copy and paste it in, and that actually puts the whole number in that field. Number of shares is how many you want transferred and you can specify certain Lots of stocks that you acquired if you desire. I didn't put anything in the Lot Acquisition date/cost and it just pulled the amount of shares I entered. You can get as detailed as you want or keep it simple.

Step 8: All that's left on the form is the signature and date. You won't need a Medallion Guarantee unless you are transferring more than $10,000 worth of shares. If you are transferring more than that, please refer to the second link above for all the paperwork/info you will need for the Medallion Guarantee. I personally did not need one, so I do not know anything about it. You will need to print out the form to sign it and then scan it back in as a PDF.

Step 9: Once you have the filled out and signed PDF you can simply use the Fidelity Secure Email feature to send it in. If you are signed into your account simply go to <https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/contact-us> and click on Secure Email in the lower right.

Step 10: Fill out the Secure Email form like the picture. Be sure to select your account that holds your GME shares and attach the PDF form. You can include any message you want.

Step 11: Wait. Fidelity got back to me the next day with this message, and then my shares were in Computershare on the 30th, so it took 3 days for the transfer to go through after they acknowledged receiving it.

Once your shares are in Computershare they will mail you information on how to setup your account. You will need your address/SSN and what stock you own with them to setup the account. I had entered a buy order, which had me enter my phone number, before my transfer went through so they texted me that the transfer went through so I didn't have to wait for the mail. You could probably include your phone number in the Additional Details section as well to receive a text or call notification when your transfer goes through. I'm not 100% on that part. I can add more steps/pictures of how to setup the Computershare account if needed, but it was really self explanatory once I actually had an account to setup.

That's pretty much it. It took me a lot more time trying to find information and getting answers from Computershare than it actually did to fill out the form and send it in. I would like to reiterate that this is a decision that I made after researching Direct Registered Shares and their benefits and drawbacks as they apply to my personal situation. I am not telling you to do anything, I am simply providing publicly available information in as clear a way as I can so that it is easier to make the transfer if you come to a similar conclusion. Thanks for reading and please be kind to your fellow apes, even if they ban you without reason or call you a shill for talking about Computershare. Also, feel free to repost or link this writeup if you think it would help other apes in subs I am banned from or do not have the karma to post in.

EDIT: I fixed the address for Computershare that [u/BluPrince](https://www.reddit.com/u/BluPrince/) pointed out and it messed up the formatting, but now I think its right again?

EDIT 2: I fixed the CUSIP #. Thanks to [u/tenchi8765](https://www.reddit.com/u/tenchi8765/) for the catch!
