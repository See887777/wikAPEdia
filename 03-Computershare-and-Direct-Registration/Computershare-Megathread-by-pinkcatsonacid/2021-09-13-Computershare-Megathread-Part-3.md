Today's topic is all about that DRIP. 💎💅

DRIP- Dividend Reinvestment Plan and "Plan Holdings" shares

When you buy shares through Computershare, you are automatically enrolling in their DirectStock purchase plan, or "Plan Holdings", which includes automatic Dividend reinvestment.

[From their website:](https://www.computershare.com/uk/individuals/im-a-shareholder/dividend-reinvestment-plan)

> Computershare administers dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plans, or DSPPs for short. Through a DSPP, in addition to reinvesting dividends, you may also purchase shares, directly from the companies themselves, without the high fees that many brokerage firms charge. With lower fees it is easier to start investing even with small amounts of money. Many DSPPs administered by Computershare require initial payments of only $25 or $50, even if the stock price of the company is higher. This is possible because DSPPs enable ownership of partial shares. For example, if a company's current stock price is $100 and you make a $25 purchase, you will become an owner of 0.25 shares. These partial shares have value equal to their fraction of a whole share; for example, a 0.25 share would be sold for 1/4 the value of a whole share and would earn a 1/4 dividend.

September 18 update- Confirmed- ALL shares held through Computershare are DRS. You do NOT have to convert from plan to book in order to fuk the hedgies. Shills have been complicating this topic for weeks to keep up the confusion. More on that below.

I want to be clear that there is a lot of misinfo coming directly from ill-informed Computershare reps. And quite frankly, no disrespect, I don't think they were ready for the influx of customers that has resulted from the $GME community (and our highly detailed questions regarding the mechanics of their business model.) Many of us are getting conflicting answers to the same questions, or no answers at all.

To be safe, I personally don't want to be enrolled in this reinvestment program- I want the dividends delivered to me without any hassle. In order to terminate your enrollment in the Dividend Reinvestment Program, the system will automatically sell your fractional shares *if you don't get proactive about it* (it will prompt you whether you want to keep your whole shares, which ofc you want to keep all of them). Fractional shares can NOT be held in book or certificate form, only in DRIP!!

However I have been told that you can request over the phone to only convert your whole shares to book entry, and the fractionals can be kept in a DRIP account to avoid selling them! Don't feed the hedgies!

Here's what [u/GMEJesus](https://www.reddit.com/u/GMEJesus/) had to say about it (shout out to them, they've been around for a long time!) check them out for more info!

FYI: Computershare is already equipped to handle a crypto dividend

Computershare is also the transfer agent for Overstock, who also has history with a crypto dividend.

> From [Overstock's website](https://www.overstock.com/dividend):
>
> Q: Do I need to have a digital wallet or must I be familiar with blockchain technology in order to receive the Dividend?
>
> A: No. The Series A-1 Shares are not a virtual currency or another form of anonymous bearer digital instrument. The Series A-1 Shares are conventional uncertificated securities for which a "courtesy carbon copy" of certain transfer agent records are maintained on the blockchain. The courtesy carbon copy does not play any corporate or regulatory role. Rather, the traditional books and records kept by Computershare, an SEC-regulated transfer agent govern the record ownership of Series A-1 Shares. Moreover, distributed ledger technology does not play a role in the sale, issuance, transfer or custody of the Series A-1.
>
> RECEIPT INFORMATION
>
> Q: How do I receive the Dividend?
>
> A: Investors are not required to take any action in order to receive the Dividend. On the Payment Date, investors should see their Series A-1 Shares reflected in their brokerage or other custodial accounts in which they hold their Overstock securities.
>
> Q: What happens if I do nothing?
>
> A: Investors are not required to take any action in order to receive their Series A-1 Shares As mentioned above, on the Payment Date, investors should see their Series A-1 Shares reflected in their brokerage or other custodial accounts in which they hold their Overstock securities.

This doesn't mean much in relation directly to GME and it doesn't prove anything except that Computershare has had the infrastructure in place to handle crypto dividends in the past.

So ultimately, do you have to convert from plan to book to fuk the hedgies?

NO!- See September 18 update

~~I can't find definitive proof for either argument for, or against- although I admittedly in the past have been advocating that shares must be "book" to be removed from the DTC~~ ~~based on my conversations with CS reps~~~~.~~

So, to be safe, I personally converted to book (and also [ordered a certificate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pjzfr2/behold_the_fabled_gme_certificate_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) before they stopped doing that.) There is a lot of discussion that any shares with computershare are DRS and not with the DTC but I ~~can't find definitive proof either way and I am trying very hard to avoid spreading misinfo.. and still trying to get to the bottom of it.~~

Sept. 18 Update- Plan vs. Book shares

We can put this argument to bed thanks to some resources straight from Computershare, as well as the relentless digging of the apes in the jungle.

Shoutout to [u/wolfiemum](https://www.reddit.com/u/wolfiemum/) for the resources to put this to rest.

[You can watch Penny explain it here in more detail.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c65RY22lky4) But here's the TL:DR-

There are 2 ways to hold stock: registered and beneficial.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare DD series part 3- All about the DRIP 💎🙌 Dividend Reinvestment Plan Holdings and important clarifications/updates](https://preview.redd.it/ii4z4ccf4eo71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=6394c15458763766dd13cb21860cfc1d0df4ca46)](https://preview.redd.it/ii4z4ccf4eo71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=6394c15458763766dd13cb21860cfc1d0df4ca46)

Registered is through your transfer agent (no matter the account type within that transfer agent: plan or book or certificate.)

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare DD series part 3- All about the DRIP 💎🙌 Dividend Reinvestment Plan Holdings and important clarifications/updates](https://preview.redd.it/nb37kobh4eo71.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68ce1ea25efc3bbfa5be14f18233e356f3d40e8)](https://preview.redd.it/nb37kobh4eo71.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68ce1ea25efc3bbfa5be14f18233e356f3d40e8)

Beneficial is through a broker.

That's it. It's either one or the other.

SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S BOOK OR PLAN- ALL DRS SHARES WITH COMPUTERSHARE ARE GOOD AS GOLD 📣

🚀I know for a fact my shares are removed from the DTC. 🚀

How do I know that? This is from my statement of my transfer from TDA to Computershare:

fuk the DTC

No matter what, Hedgies r fuk when you use Computershare and DRS.

*You're going to continue to see FUD attacks across the GME subs surrounding the topic. Shield wall and stand tall!!*

Important Reminder- Computershare is not a broker (And I am personally keeping my MOASS shares in my brokers to eventually find the sell button)

For reference, I personally am keeping all of my "play" shares in my various broker accounts to sell (whatever that means.) Multiple reasons for doing that but mainly, the interface is the most familiar to me and I will appreciate being able to navigate somewhat on auto-pilot when I'm sweating absolute cantaloupe balls during MOASS volatility and prices in the milli$.

There's also a $1 Million transaction limit on online limit orders with Computershare, although you can do multiple transactions per day, and you can do a theoretically limitless market order if written and mailed in, which will be executed at least once daily in a batch order.

[Here's the CS Direct Stock Handbook](https://cda.computershare.com/Content/7e2c2c4c-aeb6-4614-83a3-b67e32756a78) that outlines the different order types you can do through them, which are Limit order (day), Limit order (30 day GTC), or a written Market order. (I confirmed with CS reps that the direct stock handbook applies to all electronically held shares- even those not enrolled in dividend reinvestment.)

International Apes- Yes you can do it too!

Here are the countries listed as being served on the Computershare website

There is a valid workaround using the "[Give a Share](https://www.giveashare.com/)" program, although it's pretty expensive at $375, it's a valid option!

The IBKR Workaround

*With a disclaimer that IBKR sucks and* [so does Leon Cooperman](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs)

[Apparently there's a workaround for international apes using IBKR](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9mc38/all_international_apes_can_register_their_shares/) shoutout to [u/n01u](https://www.reddit.com/u/n01u/)! This seems to be the most legit way for anyone in any of the countries listed above to actually succeed in direct registering their shares. You can either transfer your shares to them, and then transfer them to Computershare, or buy directly thru IBKR and then transfer those to CS. Both methods have been done successfully by apes from several of the countries listed.

.. But BEWARE OF IBKR!! I'm still salty about them removing the buy button back in January and an ape never forgets so just proceed with caution on that one. 🤷‍♀️ I certainly don't endorse anyone using IBKR as their regular broker- they're the rich man's Robinhood. But this is legit as far as I can tell for apes around the world to be able to participate in direct registration!

And according to [u/n01u](https://www.reddit.com/u/n01u/), any of the 200+ countries that IBKR services can Direct register their shares! According to them, an ape successfully did this from Russia! GAME CHANGER!

How to transfer shares to Computershare

-   Don't forget to check out my previous posts in this series for more detail on my process. [Here's Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p42cuv/computershare_megathread_drs_direct_registration/) and [here's Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pficfa/computershare_megathread_part_2_withdrawing_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as well as the Smooth Brain Sunday Special computershare edition!

-   [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/) wrote [this fantastic step-by-step guide from transferring your shares from most major brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9ap23/guide_stepbystep_drs_transfer_to_computershare/). Some of them, however, can be done with just a phone call or chat! Update: [they also just posted an international guide!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pmu19h/international_apes_can_transfer_shares_to/)

-   1-800-343-3548 is Fidelity's number to DRS with Computer Share. Big thanks to [u/givemeanarchy](https://www.reddit.com/u/givemeanarchy/) for clarifying that the previously listed number here was for a certain region!

-   TD Ameritrade customers can open a Chat with Ted and do it through there, or call them 800-652-4584. I did my process through TDA but filled out a form and scanned it in. Apparently it gets easier than that!

-   Don't wanna use the phone? You can do it entirely online! [this post shows you how to avoid the phone call!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pp5xbk/i_avoided_computershare_for_weeks_because_of_my/) Big ups to [u/scoopsmacgee](https://www.reddit.com/u/scoopsmacgee/) for looking out for the phone-anxious apes!

-   Canadians! TFSA is not an option at this time! Only private equities can be held in Computershare's TFSA program, and GME is a publicly traded company! Big thanks to [u/FartClownPenis](https://www.reddit.com/u/FartClownPenis/) for this info! A quote from them: "I specifically asked her if I could do an in-kind transfer of my GME shares and she said no. Check for yourself with the dedicated phone number for TFSA 1-888-838-0955, option 1."

Running list of DRS Participating Brokers

HUGE shoutout to [u/Bibic-Jr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bibic-Jr/) for putting this together in the comments of the last post, based on valuable info collected by [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/)! Teamwork makes the meme work!

Disclaimer 1: While some brokers won't allow DRS transfer, they could still allow outbound broker to broker transfers. If that's the case, you could transfer from your current broker to an international broker such as TradeStation or IBKR, then ComputerShare. This takes longer but has been proven to work!

Disclamer 2: [Anyone Can also use Gift A Share](https://www.giveashare.com/stock.asp?buy=gamestop-stock)

Current Price per share: $360 USD

Disclaimer 3: Once transferred, don't forget to remove your shares from dividend reinvestment once they settle! This marks your shares as "book" and puts them in your name!

MAYBE?

1.  AJ Bell (🇬🇧) - Can defintiley do DRS transfers, but do not know how to tansfer to ComputerSahre yet. I'm in the process of talking To ComputerShare and teaching the transfer team at AJ Bell how to do it.

2.  Avanza (🇸🇪) - An ape has got them to accept the tranfser, and another ape has confirmed that they are testing the transfer with one account right now.

3.  Avenue (🇧🇷) - An ape is in the process of a transfer, just waiting on confirmation it works.

4.  Binckbank (🇪🇺) (Merged with Saxo. Apparently possible for a €250 fee. France is apparently having wait times of 3 weeks to 3 months)

5.  BMO Investorline (🇨🇦) call and ask to direct register with ComputerShare (possible $80 fee). An Ape has initiated a transfer, will update once it's confirmed!

6.  Consors Bank (🇩🇪) (Seems doable, you need to fill out [this form](https://www.consorsbank.de/content/dam/de-cb/editorial/nc/formulare/depot-sparplan/depotuebertrag-ins-ausland-und-sonderfaelle.pdf)and post/fax it to the bank. If any german apes can let me know if it's possible I will move it up!)

7.  DeGiro (🇪🇺) - They're in touch with ComputerShare about how they can arrange these transfers but don't have a solution yet.

8.  GBM (🇺🇲 🇲🇽) - (Shares are held in INDEVAL, and apparently in your own name. Sounds like it wouldn't be a stretch to transfer)

9.  Halifax (🇬🇧) - Seems very possible, just send an email to brokertransfers @ halifax .co.uk (but remove the spaces) with instructions to tranfser. Include broker account details, [this info about GME and CS](https://preview.redd.it/chcg63voh2n71.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5a892c3bbc299eea097ae23d43635d8be510ba). (Phone rep wasn't sure what I was talking about until I secified the DTC W/T Transmission. They put me on hold and then asked me to send the email.)

10. Lloyds (🇬🇧) - Same as Halifax share dealing, as they use the same systems.

11. Nordnet (🇸🇪) - I have been told they're looking into it much like DeGiro.

12. XTB (xStation) (🌏) ($25 USD fee for ISIN, and 0.1% of the value in case of Spanish stocks, will update if confirmed possible)

Remember- As of Sep 9, Paper certificates are not available at this time per Gamestop

I'm so sorry to those whose hopes were raised when they saw that I got a paper certificate! I don't know why they've stopped- I've heard that it was actually a paper supply issue, as in they are actually out of the pre-printed certificates, and that they're also switching to a Quick Cert system- both of those pieces of info coming from a CS rep, but they have been historically ill-informed about anything above level-1 support (like when they told me today's shares sell for tomorrow's price...🤦‍♀️ NOT TRUE) so take this with a grain of salt. They are sending me a company prospectus so I can dig a little further. It's exciting to note though, any of the countries computershare serves are available to request a paper certificate when they are available!

📣Paper certificates are NOT the only reason to direct register!📣

Don't forget to change your flair once you've registered!

✅ I Direct Registered 🍦💩🪑

There's a limited edition flair for Computershare!
