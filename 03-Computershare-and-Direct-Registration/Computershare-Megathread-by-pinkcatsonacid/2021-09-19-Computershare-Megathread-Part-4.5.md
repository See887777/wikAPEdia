[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

TA;DR- Book and Plan shares are the same- you don't have to convert to withdraw from DTC. All Computershare shares are DRS. 💎🙌🚀♾⛲

⚠ Don't feed the hedgies your fractionals- your shares are just as safe in a DRIP account! ⚠

This has been updated with an edit in [part 4 of the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pqa21g/computershare_dd_series_part_4_fighting_the_fud/hdf4tfl/?context=3), but it deserves a standalone post to stop FUD in its tracks- I and many others have been unsure of this and the answer is simple. (Go figure- shills have been overcomplicating things to confuse and frustrate us.) I've been feeding some FUD with some genuine misinfo and I'm getting this post up ASAP to address it and get the word out.

Plan vs. Book shares

We can put this argument to bed thanks to some [resources straight from Computershare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c65RY22lky4), as well as the relentless digging of the apes in the jungle.

Shoutout to [u/wolfiemum](https://www.reddit.com/u/wolfiemum/) for the resources to put this to rest.

There are 2 ways to hold stock: registered and beneficial.

Registered is through your transfer agent (no matter the account type within that transfer agent: plan or book or certificate.)

Issuer (Gamestop)>Transfer Agent (CS)>You (Ape)

Beneficial is through a broker.

Issuer (Gamestop)>Transfer Agent (CS)> Depository (DTCC)> Broker (Hopefully not RH)> You (Ape)

That's it. It's either one or the other.

Beneficial=DTC

Registered=No DTC

SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S BOOK OR PLAN- EVERYTHING WITH COMPUTERSHARE IS DRS AND GOOD AS GOLD. BUY, TRANSFER, WHATEVER! 📣

THIS IS GREAT FUCKING NEWS! That means as soon as all those shares settle next week from the avalanche of CS transactions the last few days, there's no need to convert and all those transactions will be moving through lit exchanges and... WHOOOO BOY! BUCKLE UP INDEED 🚀🚀🚀

I'm sorry for the confusion, several members of the community were trying to figure this out definitively and I feel we can now put this to rest, thanks to the help of Computershare Penny and you lovely apes. 💖

BUY. HODL. SHOP. DIRECT REGISTER.
