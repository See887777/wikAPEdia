Disclaimer: I'm not big on disclaimers because I'm just word vomiting after smoking a fresh bowl of green crayons anyway, but here goes- none of this is financial advice. This is not intended to promote direct registration as the catalyst for MOASS- I have no evidence either way on that. This is just based on my personal experience with Computershare. I have had several Q&A phone calls with reps at CS and that's where I'm getting my information from, wherever one is not sourced.

So you've been reading about Computershare and direct registration of stocks for a while. There's been a lot of buzz the last few weeks around the topic and there have been lots of posts about moving infinity pool shares to computershare.

Even with the buzz though, everyone still seems fairly divided on whether this is an elaborate FUD campaign or legit. So I [embarked on a Computershare journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p42cuv/computershare_megathread_drs_direct_registration/) to try to help demystify the experience and find out if this could indeed be a method to exposing abusive Naked Short Selling.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/6ad9aedjrqk71.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d34fe0add5b7ad70bc345912397574bf3de2a35f)](https://preview.redd.it/6ad9aedjrqk71.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d34fe0add5b7ad70bc345912397574bf3de2a35f)

🚨 FUD CONTROL 🚨

Before we go any further, let me just squash any FUD right now about whether Computershare is a legit company. They are the official transfer agent for Gamestop. (Update: They have updated the investor relations website completely and this FAQ is not currently online. This is a screenshot from the old investor website. There is not currently an FAQ on there so I'm assuming it's still under construction.)

[Here's some more information on the SEC website about DRS](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html)

Alright so even though Computershare's interface seems very boomer-like at best (and scammy at worst), it's quite legit (and could use a facelift but I digress..)

Like we saw earlier, Computershare is the transfer agent for Gamestop and is the way for you to Direct Register your shares, or DRS. Doing this puts the stock ownership in your name instead of being held in the broker's street name. This effectively pulls the certificate from the DTC's possession (which means any associated short positions must be closed) because you now personally hold*, register, and maintain your shares instead of entrusting your broker. (I don't trust a bitch 🙅‍♀️)

One of the main benefits of DRS, besides pulling the stock from DTC and closing the associated short positions, is the fact that any dividend issued will go directly to you as a registered shareholder, instead of going to your broker- effectively cutting out the middle man. So you are basically guaranteed delivery of dividends directly to you, and much sooner than if you were waiting around for your broker to locate and produce your shares to for your dividend (*glances at estimated SI....* that might take a while...)

🚨More FUD Control 🚨

*Can I sell my Computershare stock like a normal broker? Does it take longer*?

[Here's the CS Direct Stock Handbook](https://cda.computershare.com/Content/7e2c2c4c-aeb6-4614-83a3-b67e32756a78) (I confirmed with CS reps that the direct stock handbook applies to all electronically held shares- even those not enrolled in dividend reinvestment.)

. Here's a copy paste from it:

-   A Participant may sell all or a portion of the shares credited to his or her DirectStock account at any time by submitting a request to Computershare online. Methods described below may not all be available at the time of your transaction. At the time of sale, available methods shall be displayed online.

-   A day limit order (an order to sell shares when and if the stock reaches a specific price on a specific day) is automatically cancelled if the price is not met by the end of that trading day (or, for orders placed outside of market hours, the next trading day). Depending on the number of shares being sold and current trading volume in the shares, such an order may only be partially filled, in which case the remainder of the order will be cancelled. The order may be cancelled by the applicable stock exchange, by Computershare at its sole discretion or, if Computershare's broker has not filled the order, at a Participant's request made online

-   For a good-til-cancelled (GTC) limit order (an order to sell shares when and if the stock reaches a specific price at any time while the order remains open (generally up to 30 days), depending 5 on the number of shares being sold and current trading volume in the shares, sales may be executed in multiple transactions and over more than one day. If shares trade on more than one day, a separate fee will be charged for each day. The order (or any unexecuted portion thereof) is automatically cancelled if the price is not met by the end of the order period. The order may be cancelled by the applicable stock exchange, by Computershare at its sole discretion or, if Computershare's broker has not filled the order, at a Participant's request made online.

-   For any orders not designated as one of the order types set forth above, Computershare may, in its sole discretion, treat such order as a market order or batch order (an accumulation of sales requests for a security submitted together as an aggregated request). Batch order sales will be processed no later than five business days after the date on which the order is received by Computershare, assuming the relevant markets are open and sufficient market liquidity exists (and except where deferral is required under applicable federal or state laws or regulations). Sales proceeds will equal the weighted average sale price obtained by Computershare's broker for all shares sold in such batch on the applicable trade date or dates, net of taxes and fees. Any such orders received by Computershare are final and cannot be stopped or cancelled. For an additional fee, a participant may choose additional proceeds delivery option which may be available. These include electronic funds transfer and foreign currency disbursement (subject to additional terms and conditions).

~~👉 To put this to the test, I set a limit order for 30 days GTC for $2,000,000 because I had read that was the limit for online transactions. Any more will require a written request. (I have gotten mixed answers on this that vary as much as the CS reps that I talk to, so I'm honestly not sure on a definitive answer for what the transaction limit is.) But here's my $2Milli order that's currently active.~~

Here's my September 1st chat with an agent on transaction limits:

So you can set limit orders, and they settle in T+2 just like any other broker. Read on for the caveats to that.

So what are some cons to Direct registering your shares?

Overall it takes time to implement transactions with Computershare because they are not a broker and are not designed to primarily cater to retail with their interface and operations. They deal mainly with corporate inside investors and the like (where do you think Ryan Cohen holds his shares? 🤔) So keep in that in mind- that's why you keep seeing this conversation in relation to infinity pool shares. ♾⛲

I want to point out that this is not a "sudden" or "new" conversation.

It's just now gaining traction. People have been posting about it for months [(like this link where OP points out that Overstock also uses Computershare](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ocezn4/was_reading_about_the_overstock_crypto_dividend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ;)) *Edit side note-* [This comment outlines Overstock's crypto dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pficfa/computershare_megathread_part_2_withdrawing_your/hb6bsxx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *and how Computershare is already well equipped to handle an NFT/Crypto dividend.*

Dr. T first tweeted about it in May.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/5yorf86kvqk71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ecc5671e076d4746ed97356ae09231e241378f8)](https://preview.redd.it/5yorf86kvqk71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ecc5671e076d4746ed97356ae09231e241378f8)

As the tweet says, you can invest with GME with as little as $25 (or $10 recurring) but...

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ON THE DIRECT STOCK PROGRAM!👇

When you buy shares through Computershare, you are automatically enrolling in their DirectStock purchase plan, which includes automatic Dividend reinvestment. This is different than a book entry- which is what I want for my infinity pool.

What does dividend reinvestment mean? It means traditionally companies give cash dividends to their shareholders and Computershare makes it easy to grow your fractional investment by automatically reinvesting any dividend payments in that stock. But as we all know, we're hyped af because there's buzz about an NFT dividend- which I was unable to get an answer from CS reps regarding- they told me any info regarding that will come directly from the company.

~~To be safe, I personally don't want to be enrolled in this reinvestment program- I want the dividends delivered to me without any hassle.~~ ~~In order to terminate your enrollment in the Dividend Reinvestment Program, it will automatically sell your fractionals if you don't get viglant.. If you have whole shares in addition to your fractional shares, you have the option to keep them rather than sell them, while still terminating your enrollment in the dividend reinvestment program.~~ ~~Just something to keep in mind.~~

Update September 19-Book and Plan shares are the same- you don't have to convert to withdraw from DTC. All Computershare shares are DRS. 💎🙌🚀♾⛲

⚠ Don't feed the hedgies your fractionals- your shares are just as safe in a DRIP account! ⚠

This has been updated with an edit in [part 4 of the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pqa21g/computershare_dd_series_part_4_fighting_the_fud/hdf4tfl/?context=3), but it deserves a standalone post to stop FUD in its tracks- I and many others have been unsure of this and the answer is simple. (Go figure- shills have been overcomplicating things to confuse and frustrate us.) I've been feeding some FUD with some genuine misinfo and I'm getting this post up ASAP to address it and get the word out.

Plan vs. Book shares

We can put this argument to bed thanks to some [resources straight from Computershare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c65RY22lky4), as well as the relentless digging of the apes in the jungle.

There are 2 ways to hold stock: registered and beneficial.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/lmkhd0hk7ho71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=963703ab2ed49c6d25ec0502ff01294c85a33b74)](https://preview.redd.it/lmkhd0hk7ho71.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=963703ab2ed49c6d25ec0502ff01294c85a33b74)

Registered is through your transfer agent (no matter the account type within that transfer agent: plan or book or certificate.)

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/lov9wt7m7ho71.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fddabfc611f541e5d56490b0903266068ead6a)](https://preview.redd.it/lov9wt7m7ho71.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fddabfc611f541e5d56490b0903266068ead6a)

Issuer (Gamestop)>Transfer Agent (CS)>You (Ape)

Beneficial is through a broker.

Issuer (Gamestop)>Transfer Agent (CS)> Depository (DTCC)> Broker (Hopefully not RH)> You (Ape)

That's it. It's either one or the other.

Beneficial=DTC

Registered=No DTC

SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S BOOK OR PLAN- EVERYTHING WITH COMPUTERSHARE IS DRS AND GOOD AS GOLD. BUY, TRANSFER, WHATEVER! 📣

My Transfer from TDA

The shares I transferred in from TDA took about a day and a half from the time TDA told me they sent it to the time I saw it reflected in my online account! And these 50 shares are book entry and untouchable to the DTC.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/0ma0lu7ifrk71.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92920da66a40640b05850a77fef7ae4a6bd2d09d)](https://preview.redd.it/0ma0lu7ifrk71.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92920da66a40640b05850a77fef7ae4a6bd2d09d)

50 shares out of the hands of the DTC and in my infinity pool 💎🙌

I also confirmed several times with the agents on the phone that taking your shares out of their "street name" (your broker) and putting them in as a "book" entry effectively pulls those shares out of the DTC, meaning they cannot be leant out or manipulated. They are now legally owned by you in full .

📣This forces closure and delivery of the shares registered📣

Given the ease with which I actually can execute a sale if I ever choose to, I will probably transfer another 50 and make it an even 100 in my infinity pool with Computershare. I like the idea of being my own margin call of sorts 😎

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Dr. T also writes about Direct Registration in her NSG book and even talks about the CMKM/CMKX topic- when shareholders direct registered their stocks and exposed the phantom shares in circulation. *That case was quite different from GME though in that CMKM was a scam penny stock when you get down to it. The shareholders were ripped off because of this- Gamestop is different because it's not anywhere near bankruptcy with it's billis in liquid cash and legitimate business behind the investment*.🚀🚀🚀

But it's a very interesting story, as long as you remember the key differences with GME!

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/5id6o56zvqk71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfea3920851ff01c2aa496c8197e8b40e1aac902)](https://preview.redd.it/5id6o56zvqk71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfea3920851ff01c2aa496c8197e8b40e1aac902)

"Demanding their certificates"= Direct share registration

So there has been precedent set that we can refer to that confirms direct registration of enough shares can expose the phantom shares resulting from abusive naked short selling.

Can you get a paper certificate?

UPDATE September 9, 2021- Physical Shares have been disabled and cannot be requested now!!

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/7i07j8zar9n71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a112a3ab7621951d446979992880b5dd4cb7391)](https://preview.redd.it/7i07j8zar9n71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a112a3ab7621951d446979992880b5dd4cb7391)

Customer service on the phone also told me it was due to an actual paper supply issue, and also that Gamestop is in the process of switching to a quick cert system, so this is hopefully temporary!!

____

I was able to request a paper certificate from within the online investor center on Computershare! I did not have to make a phone call or anything.

It cost me $25 and took 3 business days to reach me! The $25 was charged directly to my linked debit card/ bank account.

Here's my most prized possession (sorry kids)

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare Megathread Part 2- Withdrawing your GME shares from the DTC with Direct Registration 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/yxc6c1kte6m71.jpg?width=3872&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aa5415d7ff33c8f65fa2701f6cb7d4810d5020c)](https://preview.redd.it/yxc6c1kte6m71.jpg?width=3872&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aa5415d7ff33c8f65fa2701f6cb7d4810d5020c)

*Be advised this is literally your share- you need to keep up with it and respect it as such! You can replace it but there's a fee. You will have to mail this paper cert back in if you ever choose to sell it, so this should truly be only for forever shares!*

~~So yes, it's possible to get a physical share!!!~~

Ok so I wanna direct register some of my shares and yoink it from the DTC's greedy hands. Where do I start?

Well, first of all call your broker and ask about transferring shares out for direct registration. By definition, there is no way to do this and keep the shares in your broker account. What you are doing is effectively pulling the share from circulation and that can only be done through the transfer agent- Computershare. You're changing the name on that share from your broker's name (like TD Ameritrade in my case) and registering it under your own name.

[u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/) wrote [this fantastic step-by-step guide from transferring your shares from most major brokers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9ap23/guide_stepbystep_drs_transfer_to_computershare/)

As far as I understand, it is not necessary to have an existing account with computershare in order to transfer shares from your broker. That's just how I personally did it.

[Part 1 of my Computershare series has some screenshots and details for which steps come first and gives you an idea of approximate wait times.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p42cuv/computershare_megathread_drs_direct_registration/)

What about international apes?

Apparently [there's a workaround for international apes using IBKR](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9mc38/all_international_apes_can_register_their_shares/) but beware. I'm still salty about them removing the buy button back in January and an ape never forgets so just proceed forward with caution on that one. Seems legit though. 🤷‍♀️ I certainly don't advocate for anyone using IBKR- they're the rich man's Robinhood.

Edit: Now seeing some comments saying there's also a workaround by using the "Give a Share" program through CS, although it's pretty expensive at $375 (That could vary, I have no idea. That's just based on comments!)

Countries listed as being served on the Computershare website:

-   Australia

-   Canada

-   Channel Islands

-   Hong Kong

-   Germany

-   Denmark

-   Spain

-   Ireland

-   Italy

-   Netherlands

-   New Zealand

-   South Africa

-   United Kingdom

-   United States

-   Sweden

-   Switzerland

-   China

I don't have a lot of details or resources for international apes so I strongly encourage you to contact your broker and/or computershare.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

A few quick FUD-fighting talking points before we wrap it up

*Most of these are from my notes in speaking to customer service*

-   Computershare does NOT place a 30 day hold on any investor account as a regular practice. If this has in fact happened to an account, it was a cautionary measure prompted by an individual's bank.

-   Purchases through Computershare don't necessarily need to be routed through IEX because you are pulling those shares out of circulation anyway. No more dark pool manipulation :)

-   Buying shares through the directstock purchase program took a total of 8 business days from initiating transfer to settlement of the share.

-   Transferring my 50 shares from TD Ameritrade literally took a day and a half. I received a message from TDA at like 5 am Eastern on Monday that the transfer was initiated. By Tuesday afternoon they were in my Computershare account when I logged in (although I wasn't prompted by email or message yet. I have just been checking obsessively 👁👅👁)

-   There is a way to find out the number of shares registered, but that would be handled through Gamestop investor relations and I'm awaiting a response on that.

-   One of the key takeaways for me is the fact that there is a difference between your whole, book-registered class A stock (like what is transferred in from your broker) and the shares purchased through the DirectShare program. Whole registered shares in your book name are better than gold.

-   I did not incur any fees on either side of the transfer process- from TDA or CS.

-   I will again stress that this entire process takes time, and while selling is certainly possible within a few days to settlement, Computershare is not a regular broker and not fit for regular trading and definitely doesn't provide any kind of instant gratification. *No gamification here, GG!*

Finally, I leave you with this tinfoil teaser in response to [this tweet from DFV back in June.](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400474857733705728?s=20) Maybe he's been trying to tell us all along. 🤔🤷‍♀️

Cone-poo-chair- Computershare... It was there the whole time 👀

TL:DR- Computershare is a proven-effective way of exposing the "phantom shares" resulting from abusive naked short selling and is a way for retail investors to pull shares out of DTC circulation and keep them safely direct registered in their own name with the company. It is best suited for those not looking to trade in a hurry and makes an ideal situation for infinity pool shares. Just be aware of the difference between "DirectStock" and "book entry" shares with Computershare!

Fuck you DTC
