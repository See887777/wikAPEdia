Confirmation Bias First 🚀🚀🚀

"If the longs had known that they have the right to ask for their shares, and they really wanted a short squeeze, that's what they would've done."- International Broker's Thomas Peterffy regarding January 28th.

Credit to [u/yesbabyyy](https://www.reddit.com/u/yesbabyyy/) for revisiting this old interview from February with our newly gained wrinkles. This must have glossed over most of our marble-smooth brains the first time it circulated. But it confirms straight from the horse's mouth that Direct Registration and exercising your right to ask for your shares IS THE WAY! 🚀🚀🚀

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare DD Series Part 4- Fighting the FUD with Facts (and confirmation bias!) DRS is the way and YOU are the catalyst 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/xyyfo0iuv2o71.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaca4a42898078279d8db4d72f456b63b2e58d18)](https://preview.redd.it/xyyfo0iuv2o71.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaca4a42898078279d8db4d72f456b63b2e58d18)

It was 🚀🚀🚀

Know your power 💪 I'm talking to you!!

Every single DRS share makes a fucking difference.

I realize there is a shit-ton of FUD flinging happening around this topic now. The shills have decided that since they can't silence the message of DRS, they will distort it with misinformation and confusion. In an effort to combat this, these Computershare DDs will keep on coming with updated information to fight that FUD with facts. This community has yet to encounter a FUD attack this elaborate, and that means DRS is the fuckin way. 🚀🚀🚀

I have to quote [u/zenquest](https://www.reddit.com/u/zenquest/) here because this is excellent perspective to understand THE POWER THAT EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR HOLDS, EVEN WITH 1 SINGLE SHARE.

*quote*:

👉 Because of this

An important thing to note is that SHFs have 1:x leverage to circulate counterfeit shares in the market. They do this to keep the price low, without which we'll see a repeat of Jan but much higher spike ultimately resulting in liquidation of SHFs.

If SHFs had unlimited leverage, they would have printed gazillion shares and make GME a penny stock, and forced everyone to paperhand by now. There would be no battle for 180, 190, or 200. The fact that they have not been able to pull the price back to even 140 is proof that they don't have unlimited leverage. Direct registration of shares at Computer share reduces SHF leverage.

The logic is pretty simple. Say for example SHFs have 1:10 leverage, for every one share that's moved via DRS to Computershare, they have to close the 10 fake shares, or increase the collateral 10 times (outstanding counterfeit share) to kick the FTD can. The more real shares that are taken away from DTC, the SHF collateral requirement goes up in multiple of leverage.

This is how big boys burned because of reckless leverage during 2008. It's similar story here. Fun fact: Steve Eiseman quoted "They took leverage for genius" in the context of 2008 financial crisis.

The ONLY thing you can do in addition to hold and buy, is really HOLD it at a safe place like Computershare. Benefits in addition to holding real share in your name vs street name include:

-   They will not lend your shares to be shorted against you

-   They don't hold IOU/counterfeit shares, so every share you hold is real

-   ETFs can't borrow/buy from them, so these shares cannot be used for short attack

-   They don't turn off the buy or sell button when you need it the most

-   DTC cannot do funny accounting like 'continious net settlement' to help SHFs kick the FTD can forever

-   In summary it's a SAFE place to HOLD. And it severely reduces SHFs leverage to conduct fraud

Moass will be very different to gamma squeeze in Jan. The initial price surge may be because of gamma squeeze/hedging, but the real rocket launch is when SHFs are liquidated because the price/risk exceeds collateral they're able to post. Once liquidation starts, the liquidators will buy share at ANY ask price.

If 1x float is registered at Computershare, Moass will last as long as it takes to buy the float multiple times. For comparison, when GME last made 3.5M public offering, it took them over a week to sell without letting the price drop precipitously. Imagine how long it'll take to buy 200M shares without share price going to billions.

Once the initial gamma/hedging price surge starts, you'll have couple of days or week for launch, which gives you adequate time [to initiate a written market order]. Or, another strategy will be to hold half at broker and half at Computershare and mitigate any uncertainty one may have.

Long term investors can keep believing that the "system" will take care of them, or they can take action to make their own destiny.

International Apes

I keep seeing FUD that you can't get involved in exercising your right as a shareholder to DRS. YOU CAN!! From over 200 countries!! Using either IBKR- International Broker or [TradeStation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pq7gu9/nonus_easy_guide_to_computershare_ibkr/)- shoutout to [u/HelloYouBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/u/HelloYouBeautiful/) for all your work on getting this out there!

The IBKR Workaround

*With a disclaimer that IBKR sucks and* [so does Leon Cooperman](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs) *and the aforementioned Thomas Peterffy. DON'T USE THEM AS YOUR REGULAR BROKER THEY TOOK AWAY THE BUY BUTTON! THEY'RE THE RICH MAN'S ROBIN HOOD!!*

[There's a workaround for international apes using IBKR](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9mc38/all_international_apes_can_register_their_shares/) shoutout to [u/n01u](https://www.reddit.com/u/n01u/)! This seems to be the most legit way for anyone in any of the countries listed above to actually succeed in direct registering their shares. You can either transfer your shares to them, and then transfer them to Computershare, or buy directly thru IBKR and then transfer those to CS. Both methods have been done successfully by apes from several of the countries listed.

.. But like I said, BEWARE OF IBKR!! I'm still salty about them removing the buy button back in January and an ape never forgets so just proceed with caution on that one. But this is legit as far as I can tell for apes around the world to be able to participate in direct registration!

And according to [u/n01u](https://www.reddit.com/u/n01u/), any of the 200+ countries that IBKR services can Direct register their shares! According to them, an ape successfully did this from Russia! GAME CHANGER!

[u/Da_Squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/Da_Squirrel_monkey/) made a fantastic post in the other sub about DRSing internationally. (Sorry I can't direct link to SS anymore because of admin code- look at their profile.)

There is way too much to copy/paste here so these users are also extremely helpful in the process: [u/HelloYouBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/u/HelloYouBeautiful/), [u/Bibic-Jr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bibic-Jr/), [u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/), [u/bossmighty](https://www.reddit.com/u/bossmighty/), and I may add to this list because there are more than I can remember! Check out all their recent posts to see how to DRS around the world (although fees can vary and some are high!)

DRS withdraws your shares from the DTC. 💎🙌

September 18 update- Confirmed- ALL shares held through Computershare are DRS. You do NOT have to convert from plan to book in order to fuk the hedgies. More on that below.

Yes you are able to keep fractionals enrolled in DRIP rather than selling them, but you have to be proactive! Otherwise, when you terminate your enrollment with DRIP through the online investor center, it will automatically sell your fractional share because fractional shares can NOT be held in book or certificate form. [See September 18 update!]

SELLING IS NOT MANDATORY, THERE IS A WAY TO AVOID THIS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WEEKS AGO. 😭😭😭😭

Yes I accidentally paperhanded for science 🧻🙌.

The anatomy of a Computershare GME sale 👩‍🔬🔬

Now, paperhanding for science gave me a unique opportunity, as much as it fucking hurt to sell a even little bit of a share (even though I literally just bought it the week before)..

I was able to analyze the anatomy of a Computershare transaction with GME. And test how long it takes to receive your payment- This is the most important FUD to fight!

YOU CAN SELL EASILY THROUGH COMPUTERSHARE! AND GET YOUR PROCEEDS IN A LITTLE OVER A WEEK! Anything you see saying otherwise is straight FUD.

Let's look at the sales statement and check they sent me.

[![r/GMEJungle - Computershare DD Series Part 4- Fighting the FUD with Facts (and confirmation bias!)

Trade date: Aug 31, 2021. I executed my enrollment in the DRIP plan and since I only had fractional shares, it automatically sold the shares. If I had had whole shares, it would have prompted me whether I want to keep them (of course I would.)

Settlement date: September 2, 2021

Sale Price per share: $216.75. *Now the question becomes.. where did they get this price?*

Remember that market orders through Computershare are executed in batches at least once per day.

On September 1st, it only got up to $[212.97](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/GME#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-).

So the sale price of $216.75 had to be based on that same day I made the "request".

*Remember this was executed in a batch market order around the time of terminating my DRIP enrollment. That's the same type of order you would execute during MOASS, assuming CS doesn't up their $1M limit.*

I received the check in the mail on September 11- which is roughly 8 business days after "requesting" the sale.

So selling GME through Computershare is arguably comparable with selling any stock through your broker. I've never sold GME through a broker so I honestly don't have comparison. But looking back at my timeline, I am completely satisfied enough with this timing to confidently DRS more of my shares!!

👉Remember that you can also perform limit day and limit 30 day GTC orders online up to $1 million, and submit a market order in writing and overnight it to be executed same day as they receive it!

Having said that, I am still staying just as diversified across brokers and have a few ammo loaded in each for when MOASS strikes to eventually find the sell button.

Here's the fee schedule for reference:

Sept. 18 Update- YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVERT ANYTHING! ALL SHARES HELD THROUGH COMPUTERSHARE ARE DRS- Direct Registered!

There are 2 ways to hold stock: registered and beneficial.

That's it. It's either one or the other.

SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S BOOK OR PLAN- ALL DRS IS GOOD AS GOLD 📣

I will once again reiterate that this is not a new conversation

Computershare has been a topic suppressed for months, as you can tell by the fact that it hasn't been able to gain traction this entire time, in spite of being brought up since the beginning. I believe we have been distracted with intelligent sounding, highly awarded and promoted DD for months to hide just how fucking simple it really is to take back the power to the players.

To the hardcore naysayers saying I'm pushing FUD and this came out of nowhere-[I have extensive proof](https://imgur.com/Ftphw0U) that this was a conversation brought up to a "dd team" while I was in my position on another sub many months ago, and it was brought up at the suggestion of a trusted team member to assign the "wrinkle brains" to investigate computershare to expose phantom shares. And that was after extensive conversation with several of the industry experts that the community has come to trust. *This was in May.*

I mentioned that in my Part 1- and there are some details in the comments there. I am not saying this to imply that this information was intentionally suppressed in the following months by anyone in particular- I'm not in any position to say that. But it was always nagging in the back of my mind ever since May why the project was abandoned and it's why I was so determined to investigate DRS once I got settled in the Jungle.

[Now we know why DRS was suppressed in our communities for so long.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pmjrss/if_this_is_true_hell_yeah/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Retail owns the float (likely multiple times over.) [Part 3 has more info on that!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pnqi5p/computershare_dd_series_part_3_all_about_the_drip/hd9bh5p/?context=3)

Extra support that DRS is legit and not a FUD campaign.

So Direct registering your shares puts you in an entirely different legal status as a shareholder, with a lot more protections when you direct register. This is a major fact to fight FUD with!

Computershare Reps have been giving conflicting answers- unintentionally adding to the FUD. Be kind and keep that in mind.

I want to be clear that there is a lot of misinfo coming directly from ill-informed Computershare reps. And quite frankly, no disrespect, I don't think they were ready for the influx of customers that has resulted from the $GME community (and our highly detailed questions regarding the mechanics of their business model.) Many of us are getting conflicting answers to the same questions, or no answers at all. Let's be patient with each other as we navigate exercising our shareholder right to register our shares and withdraw from the DTC.

How to transfer shares to Computershare

-   Don't forget to check out my previous posts in this series for more detail on my process. [Here's Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p42cuv/computershare_megathread_drs_direct_registration/) and [here's Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pficfa/computershare_megathread_part_2_withdrawing_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as well as the Smooth Brain Sunday Special computershare edition!

-   [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/) wrote [this fantastic step-by-step guide from transferring your shares from most major brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9ap23/guide_stepbystep_drs_transfer_to_computershare/). Some of them, however, can be done with just a phone call or chat! Update: [they also just posted an international guide!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pmu19h/international_apes_can_transfer_shares_to/)

-   1-800-343-3548 is Fidelity's number to DRS with Computer Share. Big thanks to [u/givemeanarchy](https://www.reddit.com/u/givemeanarchy/) for clarifying that the previously listed number here was for a certain region!

-   TD Ameritrade customers can open a Chat with Ted and do it through there, or call them 800-652-4584. I did my process through TDA but filled out a form and scanned it in. Apparently it gets easier than that!

-   Don't wanna use the phone? You can do it entirely online! [this post shows you how to avoid the phone call!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pp5xbk/i_avoided_computershare_for_weeks_because_of_my/) Big ups to [u/scoopsmacgee](https://www.reddit.com/u/scoopsmacgee/) for looking out for the phone-anxious apes!

-   Canadians! TFSA is not an option at this time! Only private equities can be held in Computershare's TFSA program, and GME is a publicly traded company! Big thanks to [u/FartClownPenis](https://www.reddit.com/u/FartClownPenis/) for this info! A quote from them: "I specifically asked her if I could do an in-kind transfer of my GME shares and she said no. Check for yourself with the dedicated phone number for TFSA 1-888-838-0955, option 1."

HUGE shoutout to [u/Bibic-Jr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bibic-Jr/) for putting this together based on valuable info collected by [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/)! Teamwork makes the meme work!

To anyone thinking this is dancing with market manipulation- that's what they want you to think

Cramer gives stock advice for a fee. He's not a financial advisor. They only want you to think you can't convene here and discuss a stock you like. And I've got news for you. GG doesn't give a flying fucking mayo about the subreddits where retail gathers.. let alone whether one is "public" or "private". He even said so much to Cramer recently (he declined to comment directly on GME but he still defended retail pretty vehemently).

> "People come on your show and they advocate either to buy or sell a security. Before we had television, people did it on the radio, now we have various social media platforms. That's not only free speech, but it's part of what makes our capital markets robust, that people can disagree and disagree using the media of the day..."- Gary Gensler on the trash they call CNBC with Jim Cramer.
