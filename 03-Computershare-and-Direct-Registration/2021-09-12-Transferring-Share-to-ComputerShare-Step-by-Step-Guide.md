[How to DRS with ComputerShare 🚽](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22How%20to%20DRS%20with%20ComputerShare%20%F0%9F%9A%BD%22&restrict_sr=1)

This guide is constantly evolving with the most up-to-date information. Bear with me as I do my DD on what I receive. Last Update 23 Sept 9am (NYC Time)

🙏 🙏 : guys, I'm absolutely overwhelmed and honoured by the traction this post got. I seriously wasn't expecting this and I'm so glad apes are finding it useful. I'm doing my best to keep it up-to-date and read all your comments/suggestion to improve it day after day. I also want to thank everyone for the awards. At this point, please keep these for the other wrinkled apes! 🙏 🙏

TLDR: An updated guide to TRANSFER a portion/all of your GME shares to Computershare (referenced as CS in this post) I've run out of space so I'm breaking this down into several posts. This guide covers most US brokers as well as Wealthsimple and IBKR). [See link here for other international brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ppw723/transferring_shares_to_computershare_part_2_a/)

Part 2 is covering the following brokers: [Commsec, DNB, Disnat, Danske Bank, Hatch, Lynx.nl, Nordnet, Questrade, RBC, Revolut, Saxo, Scotia iTrade, Stake, SwissQuote, TD Canada Trust, Tiger Broker, Tradestation, XTB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ppw723/transferring_shares_to_computershare_part_2_a/)

Part 3 is covering the following brokers: [Chase/JP Morgan, E*Trade, Rabobank, SoFI, Tastyworks, TradeZero, Vanguard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pt6ya6/transferring_shares_to_computershare_part_3_a/)

This sexy ape called [u/Bibic-Jr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bibic-Jr/) is also keeping a good log of all brokers. It's worth checking if you can't find your broker in Part 1, Part 2 or Part 3

NOTE: For apes holding accounts with tax benefits (401K, RRSP, TFSAs), you should check that transferring is in your best fiscal advantage. For example, any Canadian apes wanting to transfer from a TFSA or RRSP account is more likely to have the shares sold by broker to settle fiscal implications before sending to CS. Because you have to deal with CS USA, you won't be able to have these shares sitting on a CS TFSA or RRSP equivalent.

NOTE: While some brokers won't allow DRS transfer, they should allow an outbound broker-to-broker transfer. If that's the case, you could transfer from your current broker to a new broker allowing DRS transfer then CS. It takes time but can be done.

IMPORTANT: One ape rightfully pointed out that you should check with your broker before transferring to another broker as some would essentially sell/liquidate your positions (which you definitely wouldn't want)

Some DD to understand more about DRS and Computershare

-   [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/): [Direct Registering Shares (DRS) is the MOASS key handed on a golden platter. Dr T has been preaching this for months with CMKM as an example that exposed phantom shares. ComputerShare is not some shady company. They are the designated transfer agent for 37.4% of the market.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pps2yj/direct_registering_shares_drs_is_the_moass_key/)

-   [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/): [Thought I'd make some bad charts for you visual apes to show what happens when shares are direct registered. Hope this clears things up!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ptp3a4/thought_id_make_some_bad_charts_for_you_visual/)

-   [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/): [ComputerShare and DRS is the way. It ignites the squeeze because it's equivalent to an investor-driven share recall. You aren't transferring shares, you are transferring CERTIFICATE ownership away from the DTC and into retail's hands. Shares can be replicated infinitely. Certificates can NOT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/prpum9/computershare_and_drs_is_the_way_it_ignites_the/)

-   [u/zenquest](https://www.reddit.com/u/zenquest/) : [Why direct ownership of GME at Computershare is the most likely trigger and what's stopping](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/prsk9n/why_direct_ownership_of_gme_at_computershare_is/)

*FAQs*

A few questions have been raised so I'll try tanswering them here:

-   Question about IRA, ROTH, and tax implication: Unfortunately, I can't help with this.

-   Question about TFSA and RRSP (Canada): Unfortunately, I can't help with this. I would look at some posts from [u/Guildish](https://www.reddit.com/u/Guildish/) on that topic

-   *"How long does it take?"* - There is 2 parts to this process, the process with your broker (ie: how long it takes for them to initiate the DRS transfer) and the process with CS (ie: create your account, etc). The timing outlined below is an indication of how long it takes your broker for the DRS transfer. You will need to add up to 14 days on the CS side (they send your login via snail mail).

-   "*Do I need to transfer all to CS now?*" - Simple answer is no (unless it fits your investment strategy). You should have done your DD about your broker and understand how reliable they are on a scale from Robinhood to Fidelity. CS and DRS transfer is suited for some apes wanting to build an ♾️🏊. If I use my personal experience, I have transferred 20% of my GME shares to CS because I'm not planning on selling short or mid-term. That's my decision and it suits my investment strategy.

-   *"So why transfer to CS if I can simply not sell some of my shares to create one of these fancy pool for myself?"* - Really valid question and it's a personal choice again. For me, I want these shares in MY name, not street name.

-   "*What happens if MOASS starts while the shares are being transferred?*" - Once again, you have to be clear about your investment strategy. If you are not planning on selling these, why do you care if they are in transit? From my POV, it's a plus. I won't be tempted to touch them.

-   *"Computershare has a shitty ceiling on max sell?"* - That's true. $1m/transaction so definitely lower than my floor. Anything above this will require written notice. As per above, see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pphitt/computershare_sell_limits_per_customer_support/)

-   *"Their interface is shit. They are boomers organisation"* *-* Yep, they are. Their UI and their process is old school but keep in mind their target market is large corporations (B2B), not direct consumers. Also, THEY ARE NOT A BROKER, THEY ARE A TRANSFER AGENT/REGISTRAR

-   *"What happens to my shares once they are 'transferred' to CS?"* - Well, it's a bit weird. As stated above, they are not a broker yet the shares will show on your Computershare account, not your existing broker account.

-   *"Will I see these shares on my broker account?"* - See above. No. Shares are being sent to CS.

-   *"What happens once the transfer has gone through with my broker?"* - You wait. I've heard about 14 days. Could be a bit longer with more apes requesting DRS transfers at the moment.

-----------------

Intro

This updated guide is aimed at providing information on TRANSFERRING some/all shares to Computershare (CS). This is NOT providing info on directly opening an account with them. If you are in the US, you can follow [this kick-ass guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ppw723/transferring_shares_to_computershare_part_2_a/) from [u/BananyaBangarang](https://www.reddit.com/u/BananyaBangarang/)

Keep in mind this is not financial advice.

You'll see in the guide a 'process complexity' from 🔷 (SUPER EASY) to 🔷🔷🔷🔷🔷 (SOMEWHAT HARD).

> One last thing, be patient and kind with the customer service reps. The same way we are learning, they are also getting up to speed with a niche topic. If you get a good experience with one of them, take another 5 min after you are done to write a referral or compliment, it goes a long way.

-----------------

Things you need to know and/or might need

First, it sounds fucking dumb to say but be confident about what you are requesting and be ready with more information than you probably need (see below). For example, you might get push-back on the DRS transfer mentioning you need a CS account. This is incorrect. This is NOT a broker-to-broker transfer, this is a transfer to an official registrar, a transfer agent to get shares in your name.

See below some useful details:

GameStop Details:

-   Ticker: GME

-   CUSIP: 36467W109

Computershare details:

-   Address:

> Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
>
> P.O. Box 505005
>
> Louisville, KY 40233-5005

-   CS DTC #: 7807

Tax Lot ID and what shares you want to transfer

This is something you have to think about. Once again, I can't help on that topic or advise as everyone has a different reason for a different Tax Method for share transfer. Some of the common ones are:

- Last In, First out: as it says, the last shares/lots you bought would go out first

- First In, Last out: the first shares/lots you bought would go out last
