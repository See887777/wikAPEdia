Old Lady Ape here,

I did it! After hours on the phone with my broker and countless live chat sessions with the computershare customer service, internet searches, and a meeting with my bank; I was able to get my paperwork completed, sent off and confirmation from my broker that the shares were transferred and are now registered in my name! (Just waiting on the paperwork from Computershare to come in the snail mail)

FUD patrol: I am not suggesting that anyone do anything, I am only providing publicly available information for informed decision making. This is nothing but Buy and Hodl but in my own name instead of the DTCCs name. Also, I have slowly provided this information in an attempt to thwart off the idea that there is any urgency to register shares. There isn't! This is not urgent! Take your time and think it through. If anything, registering shares should be considered a nuclear option. Can you win a war without nukes? Yes! Would it be nice to know that you have a nuke in your back pocket if you needed it? 🤷‍♀️ When I say war of course I only mean the personal war that each individual fights against their own personal shares being ultimately delivered.

So I am now ready to present to you, my magnum opus, A step by step method for Direct Registering shares for Apes!

Let's see if the Reddit gods let me get away with those links👀

TL;D want to read: Direct Registering shares protects them from shenanigans; pros are shares removed from DTC and in ape's own name, cons unable to sell quickly in a MOASS situation; buying shares is a little easier but not guaranteed best price, fees; transferring shares is a pain in the patutsi but registers shares you already own, fees.

If you have made an independant individual decision to register your shares:

I am going to go through 2 methods of transferring shares (Try 1st one first, then, if your broker is refusing, try the second) and then a note for international apes. Buying is pretty straight forward, I believe, but I haven't tried it because the price of GME is too volatile for poor price execution (at least for me.) Also, this does not apply to transfer of fractional shares (you can not transfer those) or shares in an IRA, 401K or retirement fund, sorry.

Edit: Many brokers are not requiring the Medallion Signature Guarantee for a transfer of less than $10,000, so you may not need this beginning portion or Phase 2. I am leaving it in to help those who will still need it.

Method 1 (try this 1st: if you want to of course, don't let me tell you what to do!)

-   Search for a bank or credit union in your area that will give you a Medallion Signature Guarantee. Start with your bank, or a bank that you have some sort of connection to. Many places will not do this unless you are a member. Try this website if you don't know where else to look <http://www.msglookup.com/index.html>

    -   If you find a place that will give you this guarantee, find out what documents you will need to prove the ownership of your stocks. (call them if you need clarification)

        -   Balance letter?

        -   Trade receipts?

        -   Broker statement?

        -   ?

    -   Will they guarantee a typed letter? (necessary for method 2)

    -   What about fees? (25-100 per $100,000 guaranteed is typical)

    -   Set an appointment (if necessary) (both methods require this guarantee, may not be needed for international apes! see note below)

-   call your broker's trading office

-   ask if your broker will allow Direct registration of stock in your name, while still acting as your broker to arrange trades? (what did they say?👀 If they do say yes, let us know! and cancel your Medallion signature appointment)

-   They said no? I thought so, Ask about transfer fees

-   Now request a "DTC W/T transmission to computershare, the transfer agent of GME". If the broker is unfamiliar with this process, tell them that since computershare is a transfer agent and not a broker, it cannot initiate a transfer. The broker will need to "contact (the broker's) back office for assistance or (the broker's) representative at DTC." (you are going to have to tell them this)

-   Long pause

-   The trade office will probably have never done this before. That's ok, be gentle but firm with them. They may ask you questions. It is against SEC rules for computershare to initiate this transfer, no matter how much that is the normal way of doing business.

-   Do they come up with a solution for you? Does it require the ACATs number of Computershare? If yes, that is not going to work, computershare is a transfer agent and does not use the ACATs system. Repeat the part about contacting their back office or their rep at the DTC.

-   Solution now? Maybe they have a form for you to fill out, perhaps the Transfer shares as a gift form (not for retirement funds) If they have a form confirm the inclusion of the following things (read over every box of the form with the broker! and make sure you know exactly what it means! The form or any solution should include the following information:

    -   Your Brokerage account number

    -   The complete name of Transfer Agent (or recieving firm): Computershare Investor Services

    -   your Tax ID number (TIN/SSN): (this had to be added to my form, in the presence of the Signature guaranteer)

    -   Exact Registration with complete name and address: (on computershare account, if you have one; or your broker's account) (address had to be added to my form in the presence of the guaranteer)

        -   FYI: Computershare will make you an account upon reciept of unique name, tin/ssn, and address after transfer of shares

    -   Exact number of shares to be transfered: (whole shares only!)

    -   The full Cusip number of Gamestop Corp: 36467W109

    -   Medallion signature guarantee (like a notary but for finance, more about that later)

-   Other info that may be included on the form

    -   The DTC number of Computershare: 7807

    -   full address of Computershare: PO BOX 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000

        -   (OR overnight courier address (Fed Ex/UPS/DHL,etc.): Computershare, 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY, 40202)

    -   type of registration: Individual, Joint Tenant, ETC... (your broker account is already registered like this what is it?)

    -   lot acquisiton date and lot acquisition cost. (just means the date you bought (trade) those specific shares and the cost, found on your trade reciepts)

-   Where will you send this form?

-   Did that work?! If so congratulations, you can move onto phase 2

If not, don't hang up!, Method 2 Request to have computershare submit your transfer request to the DTC:

-   You will need to ask your broker:

    -   Broker's full name and address for sending paper transfers:

    -   Broker's DTC number: (it is 4 digits)

-   If you were following along, you will have already gathered

    -   Your brokerage account number, Your exact registration complete name and full address

        -   Computershare's full name and address, What type of registration do you want: Individual, Joint Tenant, ETC...

        -   any other instructions (How many of your shares do you want to transfer, any ones in particular)

Phase 2 for both methods! Don't hang up.

-   You will need to get those documents required for the Medallion signature guarantee. What were they? Make sure you get them or know how to get them while still on the phone.

    -   balance sheet?

    -   trade receipts? (this form also allows you to verify GME cusip number, and share lots)

    -   statement of ownership? (most recent monthly statement with those shares included)

    -   ?

Final Countdown

Method 1, final steps: Verify that the information you are including on your forms is all that is required for computershare to accept the transfer. Do this by going to their website and live chatting with them, get an emailed copy of your conversation (click the + on the chat bar and ask that the conversation be emailed to you, print it out) fill out those forms your broker gave you, if you needed to add information to the forms per computershare, wait to do that in front of the guarantee agent, or bring 2 copies of the forms, one with the added info and one without. Do not sign the form until you are in front of the guarantee agent. Bring all your documents to your medallion signature guarantee appointment and the print out of the verification from computershare. If they were unsure what you would need, bring the documents suggested above at least. Make copies! Mail it off! (overnight if desired)

Method 2, final steps: Verify that the information you are including in this letter, is all that is required for computershare to forward the transfer request to the DTC, verify where to send this letter. Do this by going to their website and live chatting with them, get an emailed copy of your conversation (click the + on the chat bar and ask that the conversation be emailed to you, print it out) You must submit a signed written request and get this letter Medallion signature guaranteed! The place you are getting this guarantee from may have an opinion about how this letter looks. Can you type up this document with them at your appointment? Maybe call again to find out.

So a letter might look like:

To whom it may concern,

> [your name] (all names if joint account)
>
> [your SSN/TIN # (all if joint)]
>
> [your address]
>
> [your awesome city, state 000007-0004]

request a DTC W/T transmission from:

> Broker name
>
> Attn: TOA
>
> PO Box 00000
>
> City, state 00000-0000
>
> DTC number 0000

account # (at your brokerage)

for (how many shares?) Gamestop Corp, GME 36467W109 shares (Or do you have shares in particular you want to transfer? specify lot acquisition Date and cost for each number of shares found on your trade receipts)

to be direct registered (individually or Joint...) in (my, our) name, [your name, all names if joint], with:

> Computershare
>
> PO BOX 505000,
>
> Louisville, KY 40233-5000
>
> DTC number 7807

Sincerely, [(or) with Love xoxoxo,]

Get this letter Medallion signature guaranted so leave the bottom half of the paper empty for the stamps**.** Do not sign the form until you are in front of the guarantee agent. Bring all your documents to your medallion signature guarantee appointment. If they were unsure what you would need, bring the documents suggested above at least and your printed copy of what computershare verified for you. Make copies! Mail it off to computershare! (overnight if desired)

Whew! So you can see this will be a pain in the patutsi and time consuming but the relief I felt knowing that my own shares weren't being messed with, was worth it for me. I hope this list helps reduce some of the run around and difficulty for you a little bit.

International Apes: Please call your broker first. Some of them are really easy to direct register shares from (wealthsimple). They are used to communicating with the transfer agent directly and will just do it. Others are pretty impossible and there may be no way of registering your shares in your name.

TLDR: If you want to hold longterm ♾ stock in your name, this is how

I just like the stonk! and these... these stonks are mine, for infinity.

Ape no fight Ape, please be gentle, 🤗💎👐♾🚀

***The first method worked for me and I acquired the knowledge of the other method through many attempts at getting straight answers. I cannot promise they will work for you. It is up to you to verify with your broker, computershare and guaranteer that these will work (my suggestions for verifying is included in the steps above).

*None of this is financial advice.* *I am an old lady that just found out that WTF has a bad word in it! Don't take advice from me!*

*In a healthy, free and fair market, direct registering shares should not cause any problems. I share this publicly available information without any intention of causing problems. I just like the stock, believe in the company and want to be in full control of my shares.*

*Please do not comment number of shares that you might want to register.*

*(I am scared of direct messages so if I ignore yours, sorry. I might find a public comment of yours to answer your question in though if you don't have enough karma)*
