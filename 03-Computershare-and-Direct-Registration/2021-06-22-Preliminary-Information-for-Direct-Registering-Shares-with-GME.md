[HODL üíéüôå](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22HODL%20%F0%9F%92%8E%F0%9F%99%8C%22&restrict_sr=1)

Old Lady Ape here,

Friends, my lack of reddit skills is really hindering my ability to get this information out. My Posts keep getting deleted. But the struggle is worth it because after months of Hodling I rewatched Dr. T in her 1st interview with Atobitt and she mentioned something at the 4:20 - 5:20 mark that is really making me keep trying. We were so busy at that time worrying about naked shorts that we missed it.

TLDW : One time an issuer encouraged shareholders to get their shares registered in their own name and that caused a lot of the problems with unissued shares to be brought out into the open. So Congress passed a law saying the issuer couldn't encourage that. But, individuals are still allowed to direct register their stocks.

I have more sources regarding what direct registering your shares is and the different ways to Hodl stock in your own name. But Reddit doesn't like me putting links in my Posts for some reason so I will add links in the comments below.

But for full disclosure:

Buying through computershare (GME's transfer agent):

| Pros | Cons |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shares registered in your name | not guaranteed best price execution |  |
| Prime Brokers, MMs, DTC cant mess with your shares (Your name is on the books, pretty hard to FTD that, I would think) | Will not be able to sell these shares in a MOASS situation. Will take several days to sell! |  |
| Can Gift your shares | $25 minimum purchase and $5 fee per transaction (+.05 per share, I believe) |  |
| GME gets to have you as a wonderful shareholder of x many stocks instead of someone like Kenny | May not execute purchase of shares for days (But you can't sell them anyways so...) |  |

(look I made a chart!)

Transferring shares:

| Pros | Cons |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shares registered in your name | difficult, your broker does not want to do this |  |
| Prime Brokers, MMs, DTC cant mess with your shares (Your name is on the books, pretty hard to FTD that, I would think) | Possibel Transfer fees on your brokers side (computershare does not charge a transfer fee) |  |
| Can Gift your shares | Will not be able to sell these shares in a MOASS situation. Will take several days to sell! |  |
| GME gets to have you as a wonderful shareholder of x many stocks instead of someone like Kenny | May not execute transfer of shares for days (But you can't sell them anyways so...) |  |
|  | Medallion signature guarantee possibly required for transfer will have $50-75 fee per $100,000 value of stock being transfered. |  |

So now that we see that the cons of this are not being able to sell in a MOASS situation, it is clear that this would only be an option for shares you wanted to hodl long term like for infinity üëÄ.

Again, I have more info on this that I will try to link in the comments.

I am going to focus on transferring shares as I personally believe the price of GME is too volatile to rely on imprecise price execution. So I am going to transfer my shares but that is also because my broker does not charge a transfer fee so it is the best option for me. You will have to decide if and which option is good for you.

Edit:¬†I removed the How information in this post because I have fuller information available now in this post.

Honestly, direct registering will take more time and energy than just hodling in a brokerage. I am interested in it though because I like the stonk, I like GME, and I want to tell the DTC, the MMs, the Prime Brokers and whoever else wants to duplicate my shares because they think they could "reasonably acquire" it, that they can talk to Rick about where to put their bananas. Because these stocks are mine!

TLDR: You can direct register your stock for longterm (infinity) hodling, if you want to here is the pros and cons of buying vs transferring shares

Ape no fight Ape, please be gentle, Reddit has roughed me up today ü§óüíéüëê‚ôæüöÄ
