Old Lady Ape here,

I have a big update to share with everyone interested in Direct Registering their shares and holding them in their own name! (Best for shares that you don't want to sell during the MOASS!)

Fidelity Update Again!

It looks like you can now do the whole process over the phone!

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pn4ud5/straight_from_the_horses_mouth_drs_phone_800/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3>

Report provided by [u/yolosapien](https://www.reddit.com/u/yolosapien/) confirms that the Medallian Signature guarantee is not required for share transfers under $10,000. The form from Fidelity has always said this but I couldn't confirm that Computershare would honor it without the guarantee signature. Fidelity will apparently honor the transfer of under $10,000 and supply Computershare with the guarantee themselves.

<https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/applications/Transfer-Shares-Gift-Nonretirement.pdf>

You can go to this form, fill it out online, (The online form does not allow the correct number of spaces for some of the numbers, but if you type the numbers in notepad and then copy and paste it in, it will fit!) print it, sign (on the next page), then mail it in to the address provided or scan it back in and send a secure email through your Fidelity account.

Fidelity Form

Helpful hints for filling out this form:

Owner name- Check your Fidelity account to see who the primary owner is; if you have a joint account, put the primary owner's name first.

Recieving Firm-

> The DTC number of Computershare: 7807
>
> full address of Computershare: PO BOX 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000
>
> (OR overnight courier address (Fed Ex/UPS/DHL,etc.): Computershare, 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY, 40202)

For the Benefit of-

You! (and whoever else if the account is joint)

If you don't have a computershare account, you can add your tin/ssn and address to the form and Computershare will make you an account upon reciept

Investment name- GamestopCorp Cusip: 36467W109

> Exact number of shares to be transfered: (whole shares only!)

If you have specific shares in mind for transferring (for instance FIFO or FILO) you can be as specific as you want.

> Lot acquisiton date and lot acquisition cost. (just means the date you bought (trade) those specific shares and the cost, found on your trade reciepts available from your online Fidelity account.)

You can of course confirm this information with Fidelity. Here are some magic words to use.

> request a "DTC W/T transmission to computershare, the transfer agent of GME". If the broker is unfamiliar with this process, tell them that since computershare is a transfer agent and not a broker, it cannot initiate a transfer. The broker will need to "contact (the broker's) back office for assistance or (the broker's) representative at DTC." (you are going to have to tell them this)
>
> Long pause
>
> The trade office will probably have never done this before. That's ok, be gentle but firm with them. They may ask you questions. It is against SEC rules for computershare to initiate this transfer, no matter how much that is the normal way of doing business.
>
> Do they come up with a solution for you? Does it require the ACATs number of Computershare? If yes, that is not going to work, computershare is a transfer agent and does not use the ACATs system. Repeat the part about contacting their back office or their rep at the DTC.
>
> Solution now? Maybe they have a form for you to fill out, perhaps the Transfer shares as a gift form (not for retirement funds)
>
> Where will you send this form?

TDA Update

9/2/2021 update:

TD Ameritrade transfer agent 1-800-652-4584

[u/iamthinksnow](https://www.reddit.com/u/iamthinksnow/) Provided this awesome updated. Thanks Ape!

TDA form 371 F

<https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA371.pdf>

[![r/Superstonk - How to Direct Register Shares for infinite holding ♾💎👐 Now Easier than before!](https://preview.redd.it/wwo4f2bz64l71.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c37cd7ade6de8edfc444340fa5d8b3502ae2f1b)](https://preview.redd.it/wwo4f2bz64l71.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c37cd7ade6de8edfc444340fa5d8b3502ae2f1b)

New TDA DRS out form

> You can scan/photograph the forms and click the bell in the middle of the top of the TDA screen to go to secure email, then upload it there.
>
> Also, and importantly - the address you put in section 4 is your own address, not Computershare. Per calling the number you included and speaking to a DRS Transfer rep just moments ago, you do not need to include Computershare information, because they are the only transfer agent on file for Gamestop.
>
> SECTION 1 - If you have an existing account there that you want to transfer into, you can include that in section 1, otherwise, all other information is relating to your TDA account;
>
> 2.Your PII, or that of a minor you are the custodian for;
>
> 3.If you are a custodian (and entered the minors name in section 2), enter your information here
>
> 4.*YOUR* address & mailing address (if different)
>
> 5.Sign and date

and no medallion guarantee involved. (you can call your broker to verify this; see helpful hints for Fidelity above.)

I'd love to keep growing the list of the different ways that each broker is facilitating the Direct Registering of your shares. So please let me know if you were successful with a different broker so I can add your method to this post.

TLDR: If you want to hold longterm ♾ stock in your name, this is how, now even easier!

I just like the stonk!

Ape no fight Ape, please be gentle, 🤗💎👐♾🚀

*None of this is financial advice.* Please verify this with your broker, if you have any questions! *I am an old lady that is excited about figuring out how to meme! Don't take advice from me!*

*In a healthy, free and fair market, direct registering shares should not cause any problems. I share this publicly available information without any intention of causing problems. I just like the stock, believe in the company and want to be in full control of my shares.*

*Please do not comment number of shares that you might want to register.*

*(I am scared of direct messages so if I ignore yours, sorry. I might find a public comment of yours to answer your question in though👀)*

Edit: added information about the Form from Fidelity

Edit: changed TDA information and form!

Edit: added new Fidelity Registering info.
