Let's get a list together of all brokers that allow transfers via DRS. (The only way Computershare can receive share transfers).

There was a comprehensive list made for which broker allowed voting back in the BUY HODL VOTE days. Mine will be less impressive. But I hope it will help apes who wish to direct register, work their way through this Computershare maze!

This is the work of many apes, I thank each and every one of you for sharing all of this info with me! It is a work in progress too, so forgive me if anything is incorrect. And please share your experiences with brokers. Or let me know if I'm missing any!

Apologies for linking to screenshots instead of actual posts. There's a lot of cross post bans between GME subs I'm trying to avoid.

Disclaimer 1: While some brokers won't allow DRS transfer, they could still allow outbound broker to broker transfers. If that's the case, you could transfer from your current broker to an international broker such as TradeStation or IBKR, then ComputerShare. This takes longer but has been proven to work!

Disclamer 2: [Anyone Can also use Gift A Share](https://www.giveashare.com/stock.asp?buy=gamestop-stock) Current Price per share: $390 USD

Disclaimer 3: No matter how your shares are registered with ComputerShare, they are book and removed from the DTCC.

CAN TRANSFER

Check out [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/)'s post about how to tranfser with the majority of these brokers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9ap23/guide_stepbystep_drs_transfer_to_computershare/)

IF YOUR BROKER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND: 1. ASK FOR A DRS TRANSFER TO COMPUTERSHARE. 2. REMIND THEM COMPUTERSHARE IS A TRANSFER AGENT AND NOT A BROKER, SO THEY CANNOT INITIATE THE TRANSFER. 3. TELL THEM IT NEEDS TO BE A [DTC W/T TRANSMISSION](https://i.redd.it/8etn8d0xzqn71.jpg). (W/T means Withdrawal by Transfer!)

MAYBE?

1.  AJ Bell (🇬🇧) - Can defintiley do DRS transfers, but do not know how to tansfer to ComputerSahre yet. I'm in the process of talking To ComputerShare and teaching the transfer team at AJ Bell how to do it.

2.  Avanza (🇸🇪) - An ape has got them to accept the tranfser, and another ape has confirmed that they are testing the transfer with one account right now.

3.  Avenue (🇧🇷) - An ape is in the process of a transfer, just waiting on confirmation it works.

4.  Binckbank (🇪🇺) (Merged with Saxo. Apparently possible for a €250 fee. France is apparently having wait times of 3 weeks to 3 months)

5.  BMO Investorline (🇨🇦) call and ask to direct register with ComputerShare (possible $80 fee). An Ape has initiated a transfer, will update once it's confirmed!

6.  Bolero (🇪🇺) - (Now might be possible. €50 fee, will update once it's confirmed!)

7.  Citi Bank HK (🇭🇰) (An ape has been told they can transfer to computershare, but it doesn't sound like the agent understood how it works. Will update when I get more info!)

8.  Consors Bank (🇩🇪) (Seems doable, you need to fill out [this form](https://www.consorsbank.de/content/dam/de-cb/editorial/nc/formulare/depot-sparplan/depotuebertrag-ins-ausland-und-sonderfaelle.pdf) and post/fax it to the bank. If any german apes can let me know if it's possible I will move it up!)

9.  GBM (🇺🇲 🇲🇽) - (Shares are held in INDEVAL, and apparently in your own name. Sounds like it wouldn't be a stretch to transfer)

10. Halifax (🇬🇧) - Seems very possible, just send an email to brokertransfers @ halifax .co.uk (but remove the spaces) with instructions to tranfser. Include broker account details, [this info about GME and CS](https://preview.redd.it/chcg63voh2n71.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5a892c3bbc299eea097ae23d43635d8be510ba). (Phone rep wasn't sure what I was talking about until I secified the DTC W/T Transmission. They put me on hold and then asked me to send the email.)

11. Lloyds (🇬🇧) - Same as Halifax share dealing, as they use the same systems.

12. Nordnet (🇸🇪) - I have been told they're looking into it much like DeGiro.
