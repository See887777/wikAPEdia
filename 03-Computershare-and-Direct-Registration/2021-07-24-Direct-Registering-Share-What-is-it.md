Old Lady Ape here,

I got so many questions yesterday and today about info that was in my earlier posts (that got deleted as Spam), then my 3rd post was kind of a piece of poo. So I'm going to clarify¬†what direct registering of shares is with sources to help answer your questions.

(Edit: moved disclaimers to the end, and updated shareholder list info)

What are the different ways to buy and hodl stock?

Here is an article that goes through the different ways to buy and hodl stock (they mispell it in their article, sorry) and¬†advantages and disadvantages¬†of "DRS" (direct register) method.

<https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-direct-registration-system-or-drs-for-stocks-357536>

So did you read that? Too Long, can't read?

Basically it tells you there are 3 ways to Hodl stock

1.  buy or sell directly from the transfer agent (DRS through the link from Dr. T)

2.  work with their favorite stock-broker to arrange trades registered through the DRS

3.  work solely through their broker (registered under their street name)

Then it goes through the advantages of being registered under your own name through DRS rather than your broker's street name.

Advantages

your claim is with the company you own part of, not the intermediary

cannot be sold short, paid "in lieu of dividends" and giftable

Now I know, if your account is not in margin the broker is not supposed to be lending it out but Queen Kong said something interesting in this interviewed with chatter (link in comments below, 45min-47min mark are the pertinent times) that leads to serious questions

Speculation: Are the brokers failing to deliver our shares by just entitling our accounts with the benefits of the share? Do they never have to find it, as long as the broker has sufficient shares held on its books with the DTC? So maybe my "share" isn't being loaned out but it can be failed to deliver as long as other shares are needed elsewhere

That isn't going to happen if my shares are registered in my name.

Some Disadvantages to DRS:

can't sell stock in midst of panic, will take at least a few business days

So maybe I don't want to register all of my shares except the ones I want to keep for a long time or hand down to my children. ‚ôæ

Edit:¬†GME's transfer agent, Computershare, does allow limit sells of stock through their investor center. I have not seen convincing evidence that this is a good option for selling during MOASS so I still consider difficulty selling DRS stock firmly in the Cons list.

An¬†additional disadvantage, brought to my attention is that your name and address would be available upon request from a shareholder for the purpose of organizing shareholder meeting business. However it is unclear if this is any different than being a beneficial owner, as this information is protected by computershare and GME other than where legally required, same as with a broker.

Who is this good for:

And as a second source, here is a white paper from ComputerShare (see link in comments)

buy and hold

Bias Confirmed

TLDR: There are different ways to buy and hold my favorite stock. One way is through direct registration through GME's transfer agent Computershare. There are advantages and disadvantages of hodling stock in this way.

This is purely information. What you decide to do with this information is no business of mine. I love you apes but even my own children don't take advice from me about how nutritious crayon eating is, why would you?!

How to do this?¬†*I am working on that, now getting very close. Please see link below for Computershare, GMEs transfer agent, I have a post for preliminary info up but I haven't made revisions yet but important things to consider none the less.*

Ape no fight Ape. Be Gentle, please

The term Nuclear Infinity pool was a term I made up to describe shares that I don't want to sell.¬†Though I am a fan of the infinity pool, I can't defend the theory behind it because I don't know enough, I just know that I don't want to sell some stock to keep as a longterm investment in GME. This is a personal decision. Some people believe the infinity pool could make people liable for organizing and that it is possible that it could break the stock market. I have no knowledgable opinion on the subject. Please make your own!

I have no idea what will happen if a large amount of GME shares are registered.¬†I have only presented a possibility based on historical evidence. Anything else discussed as an outcome of this is purely speculation and in no way represents a goal or guarantee of/from myself. I specifically used the word "could" in my post to signify this. (Link in comments below "Could direct registering shares...")

I am in no way encouraging anyone to do anything with their money or shares.¬†I am only providing public information for which an individual can use in their own research to make their own decisions about their own shares.

Please do not comment number of shares that you might want to register. It is not helpful
