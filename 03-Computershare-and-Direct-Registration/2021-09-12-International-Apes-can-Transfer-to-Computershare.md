This guide is constantly evolving with the most up-to-date information. Bear with me as I do my DD on what I receive. Last Update 19 Sept 11:50pm (GMT+10)

🙏 🙏 🙏 : guys, I'm absolutely overwhelmed and honored by the traction this post got. I seriously wasn't expecting this and I'm so glad apes are finding it useful. I'm doing my best to keep it up-to-date and read all your comments/suggestion to improve it day after day. I also want to thank everyone for the awards. At this point, please keep these for the other wrinkled apes! 🙏 🙏 🙏

TLDR: IBKR seems to be a workaround for a lot of apes out of the US and Canada, particularly the Euroapes. Basically, you could open an account with IBKR, transfer or buy shares with them then start the DRS transfer.

Intro

Before I jump into the process for IBKR, let me clarify something. First, your broker might actually allow DRS Transfer (in which case this guide could be useless for you). In other cases, while your broker might not allow DRS transfer, they might allow Broker to Broker transfer. In this case, you could transfer your position from your current broker to IBKR then do a DRS Transfer to ComputerShare. Finally, PLEASE CHECK that your broker won't actually liquidate your position if you do a broker to broker transfer.

This is definitely not financial advise. I'm super retarded and tend to prefer the banana skin as a meal than the actual banana.

Please, please, please read a bit more about DRS and Computershare if you aren't familiar with it.

*FAQs*

A few questions have been raised so I'll try tanswering them here:

-   Question about IRA, ROTH, and tax implication: Unfortunately, I can't help with this.

-   Question about TFSA and RRSP (Canada): Unfortunately, I can't help with this. I would look at some posts from [u/Guildish](https://www.reddit.com/u/Guildish/) on that topic

-   *"How long does it take?"* - There is 2 parts to this process, the process with your broker (ie: how long it takes for them to initiate the DRS transfer) and the process with CS (ie: create your account, etc). The timing outlined below is an indication of how long it takes your broker for the DRS transfer. You will need to add up to 14 days on the CS side (they send your login via snail mail).

-   *"Is there anything I need to provide when you transfer?"* - Personally, I provided instruction to my broker on what shares I wanted them to transfer (ie: a log with details like X shares bought on XX of XXX for $XXX and Y shares bought on YY for $YYY, etc). I've gone with a *Last in, first out* method since I'm not planning on selling these and while this might increase my cost basis at the broker, IF MOASS was to be delayed, I would optimise Capital Gains but that's just me.

-   "*Do I need to transfer all to CS now?*" - Simple answer is no (unless it fits your investment strategy). You should have done your DD about your broker and understand how reliable they are on a scale from Robinhood to Fidelity. CS and DRS transfer is suited for some apes wanting to build an ♾️🏊. If I use my personal experience, I have transferred 20% of my GME shares to CS because I'm not planning on selling short or mid-term. That's my decision and it suits my investment strategy.

-   *"Should I trust Fidelity? Should I migrate all my shares out of Fidelity?"* - This is a recent one, particularly since the IEX issue (as in, they don't do IEX routing) and the fact that they still lend shares (how??). However, it's not a question I can answer. I'm not a US ape so don't know the ins and outs of brokers. I have done in-depth DD on it and this post isn't what I intend to cover. Personally, I would not transfer ALL my shares to Computershare but that's me. Why? Because of the cons below and because I want to optimise my exit on the way down with a broker vs Computershare (who could be slower to execute orders)

-   *"So why transfer to CS if I can simply not sell some of my shares to create one of these fancy pool for myself?"* - Really valid question and it's a personal choice again. For me, I want these shares in MY name, not street name.

-   "*What happens if MOASS starts while the shares are being transferred?*" - Once again, you have to be clear about your investment strategy. If you are not planning on selling these, why do you care if they are in transit? From my POV, it's a plus. I won't be tempted to touch them.

-   *"Computershare has a shitty ceiling on max sell?"* - That's true. $1m/transaction so definitely lower than my floor. Anything above this will require written notice. As per above, see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pphitt/computershare_sell_limits_per_customer_support/)

-   *"Their interface is shit. They are boomers organisation"* *-* Yep, they are. Their UI and their process is old school but keep in mind their target market is large corporations (B2B), not direct consumers. Also, THEY ARE NOT A BROKER, THEY ARE A TRANSFER AGENT/REGISTRAR

-   *"What happens to my shares once they are 'transferred' to CS?"* - Well, it's a bit weird. As stated above, they are not a broker yet the shares will show on your Computershare account, not your existing broker account.

-   *"Will I see these shares on my broker account?"* - See above. No. Shares are being sent to CS.

-   *"What happens once the transfer has gone through with my broker?"* - You wait. I've heard about 14 days. Could be a bit longer with more apes requesting DRS transfers at the moment.

The Process

Anyway, back to IBKR, I won't chat about how dodgy IBKR is or how shitty their founder is. I don't care about this. To me, they are a mean to an end (1. Buy shares via IEX and 2. Transfer to CS). I've been a customer with them since 2017 and they've been fine.

> # List of countries: ~~This is based on where Computershare has an office, it could be more countries.~~ This seems to be based on where IBKR operate and not being impacted by where ComputerShare is located.

> # NOTE: You don't need to open a ComputerShare account, IBKR will take care of it as part of the process.

First and foremost (and not covered in here), you need to open an account with IBKR, it's not complicated but it's lengthy and can take a few days. I'm not doing this for the money nor the fame but if you want a referral code, let me know and I can shoot one.

Anyway, so you've opened an account. Well done retard.

Now it's fairly simple. Essentially, you just have to raise a New Ticket and ask for an Outbound Transfer. If you are a grandpa at heart like me, you can attach a form (see the part at the bottom "BONUS"). TBH, I don't trust brokers and like to keep paper trails and clear instruction but if you prefer a simple ticket, it works.

BONUS

I always prefer to provide more information than probably required. That ensures I avoid the back and forward, the unnecessary delays and other BS brokers can throw at me. As such, I recommend you attach a filled form to the email just to be safe. I've created a Form. [Form is available here](https://imgur.com/a/LKElgdH)

-----------------------------

SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Well, you wait. Once you have initiated the process, here is what to expect.

-   Your ticket will be allocated to an IBKR rep. It can take from a day to 3 days.

-   They will start the process. Expect another 1-2 days.

-   Once this is done, they will tell you to contact CS about 3 days later to make sure all is fine (it should be). I've done that and CS confirmed my account was created and I just needed to wait for my registration details by snail mail (about 2-3 weeks). So yep, you gotta be patient.
