Old Lady Ape here, (may the reddit gods not take down this post)

If you have read any of my other posts, you know that I have been working on ways to direct register my shares in order to remove my infinity pool shares (shares I won't sell during the MOASS) from the DTC. (Reddit doesn't like it when I add too many links in my post so I will include a link to the original infinity pool DD down below). Dr. T had mentioned this in her interview with Atobitt and has reiterated lately that FTDs are the problem. So I am taking a break from finalizing directions on removing shares (because I am getting the MOARA, mother of all run arounds) to talk about what might happen if people¬†independently decided¬†to remove their shares (that they don't want to sell in the MOASS) from circulation.

To do this I went to look directly at a rule that is referenced by Queen Kong from the SEC. (DTC 2003-02, link below) From first glance it reminds me that the SEC doesn't ever make new rules, they just clarify them, but it is clear that this is in fact a new rule (in 2003) because there is mention of them accomodating companies in the past.

This 2003 rule is essentially¬†forbidding company transfer agents (issuer of shares) from withdrawing their shares from the DTC. The DTC will only recall shares to the issuer if the owner of the shares request them from the DTC.¬†So this is why it has been so difficult to transfer shares out, because the SEC tied the hands of the issuer from helping with this process, other than providing information, in any tangible way. But what I really was interested in was the comments. Remember when all the apes commented on that oo5 rule, and they supplied the comments for us to read? Well they added the coments on this rule too and there is gold in them thar hills!

Looks like the winners lose on this one

Apparently the SEC doesn't care how many people don't like the rule. The SEC is gonna SEC. Then they start to summarize reasons these commenters wanted companies to be able to remove their shares from the DTC.

naked shorts hmm

I read all of these for you, I know, I love you too. Let's look at some of them:

This is from 2003...

Sounds familiar. And this

withdrawing shares from the DTC

This original ape is saying that withdrawing shares from the DTC protects investors from illegal short selling. and this one too, who also gives us a handy list of things that can happen to make shorts cover. Check out the last one.

Leonard (Silverback)

"None would consent to have their shares in DTC" Hmmm exiting shares from the DTC forces shorts to cover....But what about FTDs?

Blue Industries

Sounds like Blue indutry is referencing FTD's and acknowledging that allowing companies to remove their shares from DTC would force delivery. I got to show you a few more, this one, where the ape never says he is for or against the rule but yet the SEC knows exactly which side he is on, probably from this spicy paragraph:

Jake (not from Statefarm)

There were so many more but I don't want to tempt the Reddit gods with too many pictures.

I also wanted to look at reasons against allowing removal of shares from the DTC to see if there were any valid reasons to not remove shares from the DTC.

Reasons against: Would compromise speed and possibly security of the system with regards to paper certificates in particular. Most of the against comments were regarding paper certificates, which is fair but now we are able to DR in digital form so I consider the arguments against no longer valid. Not to mention fact that almost every comment against was from this list:

-   Merril Lynch

-   RBC Dain Rauscher (a broker-dealer)

-   Ameritrade

-   Citibank

-   Edward Jones

-   Charles Schwab

-   Sterne, Agee & Leach (broker-dealer)

-   Mizuho Trust & Banking Co (USA)

-   Prudential Securities Incorporated

-   BNY Clearing Corp.

-   First Clearing Corporation (FCC), subsidiary of Wachovia Corporation

-   Bank of America

-   Fidelity Investments

-   Salomon Smith Barney (clearance and settlement)

-   A.G. EDWARDS & SONS, INC.

-   National Steering Committee of the Bank Depository User Group

-   union planters trust and investment group

-   National Investor Services Corp

-   And this guy a wall street manipulater from way back!

Kenny G, is this you?...edit: it is not him, this was a joke

I wonder what all of these companies (and that dude?) have in common? I'm guessing that they are the ones benefiting from being able to play fast and loose with delivery of actual stock. So could direct registration of infinity pool shares turn into a nuke for shorts? Looks like a yes to me.

TLDR: Naked shorts have been a problem for a long time. Until this rule passed in 2003, companies would remove their shares from the DTC to force naked shorts and FTDs into the open. Now individual investors have to personally request shares to be removed from the DTC to keep them from Rickrolling them.

I will be doing this with my infinity pool shares. I am currently working on writing up the different ways one might do this, as the broker's have made it very hard to do. Please see the links posted in my comment below if you would like to see my preliminary instructions for direct registration.

Reading all of those comments (not yours apes) made me seriously mad. This has been going on for far too long. But Kenny and the banks have messed with the wrong apes! I'm ready to make my infinity pool nuclear.

This is not financial advice. Reddit is too hard for me to figure out, why would you listen to me about anything!

Ape no fight Ape, please be kind

Edit;. There are Cons to registering shares. I got over them in a post linked below but...

It is difficult to sell direct registered shares, and would require at least several business days to transfer them back to a broker, have them settle and then sell. This would not be a good idea for shares you would like to sell in the MOASS, only shares you want to keep invested in GME long term. This is not financial advice, oh those crayons aren't sitting well in my stomache

Also, in my previous posts I list pros and cons of buying from GME verses transferring shares in. Please know the price is not guaranteed if you purchase new from them. May not be a big deal but GMEs price can be volatile.

Edit: changed flair to education. Looks like I also lost my pictures? but can still get to them when you click, correct?

Edit: fixed pictures... I think
