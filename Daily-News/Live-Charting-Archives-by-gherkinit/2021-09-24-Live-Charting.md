Good Morning Apes!

Crypto is tanking as it looks like China is attempting to pull liquidity back into their markets. S&P down about 500 points this morning so far. I expect another low volume day on GameStop Dragged around by broader market action. We have a pretty strong support at 190 and strong resistance at 195 if we slip down 185 is the next level I would be looking for. If Crypto has been used by the SHFs to bolster their margin we could see some side effects from the sell off.

After-Market

Some opportune shorting lead to a nice dip buy today and as I thought our volume dried up after about 12pm. Trading 1.66m for the second day in a row, leaves about 10m volume that needs to be traded Monday to prevent an FTD pile-up. Thank you all for tuning in, I will see you Sunday night with this weeks forward looking DD. Have a great weekend!

Edit 6 1:30

Still flat and still sub 1m volume if the SPY pushes hard we could move up to 190-192 closer to mac pain is best for the MMs

Edit 5 12:03

We no have so little volume we aren't even tracking the spy. T+69 needs 2.6 million volume today and 13m on Monday.

Edit 4 11:25

Failed 190 back at VWAP. Low volume for the rest of the day as is tradition?

Edit 2 10:24

For some reason my other edit got deleted ... GameStop testing VWAP and coming back up with the SPY. The rejection point is critical either we have seen the low for the day or we will get rejected and drop even further.

Pre-Market Analysis

8k volume traded indicates another low volume day. 760k shares available between Fidelity and Iborrow going into open. If the market continues down I expect them to use the opportunity to drive us below 190 if they can. It's acted as strong support for the last few days and a push down to close out the week would be a big win for them. Keep an eye on a dip below as it could mean we are heading into a tasty fire sale.
