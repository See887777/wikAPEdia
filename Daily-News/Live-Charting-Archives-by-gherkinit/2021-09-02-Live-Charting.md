Good Morning Apes!

It looks like we are gearing up for another test of 225 in the pre-market already moving in for what will be our 5th¬†test in the last 6 days. This is really starting to feel like the new 180. Again todays price action will largely depend on if we can break that ascending resistance and hold or not. Currently the big fear for the SHFs is the gamma ramp sitting above 225 dude to the sideways movement OI at 9/3, 9/10, and 9/17.

After Hours

Still not tracking expected price movement. But green on the day I'll take. Moving into tomorrow above max pain with the vast majority of the options chain rolled out to 9/17 we might actually see some movement on a Friday. They keep pushing this out day by day but that means when they do cover they'll have less time to do it. Less time means more volatility and with that ramp in place this strategy seems like a losing one. Thank you all, see you tomorrow.

Continuing to chop it seems like they are buying on one candle then shorting the next very odd movement

Sometimes we need to manipulate the markets a bit, throw it the old curveball

Edit 4 12:11

Almost returned to neutral, but the volume just hit a million. I expect we will have a difficult time passing 215 without a bit more.

Edit 3 10:58

broke down from the ascending channel this will either for a H&S or bounce on the 60EMA/VWAP

As bullish of a reversal as we are gonna get on this low volume but it looks good

$5 dollar drop right out of the gate, volume at 190k

Pre-Market Analysis

18k Volume with 15k shares available to borrow. It appears that the 130k shares borrowed from Fidelity yesterday have been returned. We have a nice open gap in premarket to fill up to yesterdays VWAP around 219. If we do I expect we will yet again see an early test of 225.
