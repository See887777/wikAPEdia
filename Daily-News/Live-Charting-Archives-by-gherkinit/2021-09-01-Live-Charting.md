Good Morning Apes!

I hope everyone tits are jacked!

Cause expected ranges for today look spicy. Yesterday we barely crossed into the mid-range of expected price action but as I suspected it looks like they have been covering some of that t+2 during AH and Pre-Market. Some new regulations rolls in today, and the DTCC said to expect some phone calls so it could get pretty spicy.

Low 4.31% - Mid 14% - High 22.41%

And my biggest prediction for today ?

The return of a pretty dope dude...

After Market

We broke above that upper trend this morning but I guess that test wasn't enough. Once volume died off they used that to bring us all the way back to that bounce at 208. In the meantime, at least longs took advantage of the dip as call options flooded in for weeklies, this Friday. Closed 6% down from the expected price action for today. Thank you all so much and I'll see you tomorrow.

Still trending down there is currently little to no buy pressure and a bit of shorting going on

Edit 7 12:25

VWAP is still up at 222 but we are continuing on this consolidating downtrend. Looking for some volume to come back in after lunch.

Edit 5 10:38

Breaking up from this bear flag shows a pretty solid amount of buy pressure rolling in I think we could see another test

Big short attack down to 215, hopefully the resistance holds

Pre-Market

Volume already at 50k, with only 30k shares available to borrow. We have been on a pretty consistent uptrend since market close. I suspect that they are attempting to cover as much gamma exposure from last week as they can before market open. After an initial test in pre-market, it looks like GME is well on the way to a second test of 225 this morning. This resistance is very important as it represents a break to the Higher ascending trend.

Ascending channel breakout point 1D

It looks like so arbitrage took place this morning I will monitor cv-vwap and let you guys know if anything happens.
