Good Morning Apes!

I'm pretty stoked to have our first open after a green day in weeks. It looks like that for now we found a pretty solid floor at 145 and I'm going to use today as a confirmation of that bounce or if yesterday's price action was simply gamma exposure from Tuesday. I suspect the latter because price action yesterday was almost exactly inverse Tuesday's.

Edit 4 12:46

We are in a head and shoulders breakdown but there isn't actually enough volume for it to breakdown... So we just aren't moving 800k traded so far,

Chopping under VWAP volume is very low but holding that 152 resistance

Edit 1 9:48

Looks like we failed that initial test at 157 it looks like we have some support at 152 and some at 150 so a turn around is possible here but if the morning volume dies of before then we may be flat for a while

Pre-Market Analysis

We had a pretty nice gap-fill back up to a test at 157 right away, which actually looks pretty bullish for price action going into opening bell. Volume is still low right around 14k but it could pick up into market open. There are 250k shares now available to borrow on Iborrow ,and since they seem to be using them now as well, 800k available on Fidelity. This is what worries me is that if our volume remains low and they go after these 1.05M shares we could definitely see a dip back down to that floor before we close today. Max pain today however is above us sitting at 162.5 and the gamma ramp starts at 160 so this could be an interesting day.

I took our longer term trend down to the 1h timescale so you could better see the bounce. It looks like yesterday we bounce right on that lower theoretical support that we predicted at the beginning of the week. For a technical standpoint we look great for a fill all the way back to 180 as long as this trend continues.

Weekly TA on the 1h Timescale

Also MACD crossed had a bullish crossover on the 4h and should soon see a crossover on the 1D if price continues upwards
