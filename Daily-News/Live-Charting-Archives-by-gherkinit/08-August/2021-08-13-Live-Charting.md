After Market Party

Well we fucking did it! We closed 2.50 above max pain for the first time since the share offering. The shorts and MMs are starting to lose ground the signals are lining up and we are ready for another run. Expect this trend to accelerate into next week as we begin our turnaround. Thank you all for the great week and support, see you Monday!

Edit 4 2:34

Dropped out of that earlier channel and bounced back at 161 after a share borrow of 50k. Still looks like we will trend up into EOD but the volume remains stagnant 720k traded so far.

Edit 3 12:59

Continuing our uptrend while mms and shfs try to avoid jumping the ask it's pretty fun to watch even though it is very slow but...only up for now

Edit 2 12:17

Came up a little bit volume is still dry @ 475k some of the borrowed shares were returned. We have had a few 0 volume minutes like yesterday so I'm looking for a bit of a run going into power hour.

Edit 1 11:00

Haven't been able to post this all morning. Slid down at open with shorts and about 500m in ITM options coming we've now popped up above VWAP and are chopping. Volume is really low @ 350k so far.

Pre-Market Analysis

Volume this morning is complete garbage again only 5k shares traded so far. 465k shares borrowed this morning so expect shorting, especially because today is the first Friday we have opened above max pain in weeks (currently at 160). The bid ask spread keeps getting wider as liquidity continues to drop and apes take advantage of the fire sale. We are also sitting right on the edge of that gamma ramp so if we see some upward price action today the SHFs are going to have to work against the MMs to drop the price, Should be an interesting Friday...
