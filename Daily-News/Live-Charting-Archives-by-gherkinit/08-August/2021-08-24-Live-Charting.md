Good Morning Apes!

Yesterday we ended up seeing 3.5% gains on ~1M volume. Yesterday the Bollinger bands snapped back inside the Keltner Channel briefly giving us that fire signal we were looking for from TTM Squeeze. This means two things increased volume and volatility and an inferred move to the upside. With our wide bid/ask spread we can really move on very little volume as we saw yesterday. Additionally today is t+2 for Market Makers gamma exposure (GEX) from Friday. Needless to say it should be a wild ride. Our predicated price range¬†yesterday¬†for the low estimate was 158.27 -165.82 we stayed basically within that range as GME at 8pm EDT yesterday stopped trading at 165.89. Meaning the tweaks I did this week seem to be a bit more accurate.

Today's Expected range is :

Testing 210 we a really taking off far harder than anticipated. Quarterly options t+37 and t+2 gamma exposure in addition to the gamma ramp are putting a lot of fuel in this rocket

Actually just ripping volume is far higher than predicted look at us go...I will adjust volume for tomorrows estimate to compensate for this move. Looks like we are ready to bounce off 190 VIOLENT UPSIDE POTENTIAL is in effect

Pre-Market Analysis

Volume currently at 12k with 20k shares available to borrow our premarket high was 167.80 and currently trading at 166.90. We have a nice uptrend since market open and since there are still no shares to borrow we have a pretty good chance of a 170 test right around market open. Additionally the S&P looks stable after testing new ATHs yesterday so we may have the market running with us again today.

BBKC and TTM on the 1D both firing together into today

There is no significant arbitrage yet but I do expect a signal on CV_VWAP in the next few days so I will be monitoring it.
