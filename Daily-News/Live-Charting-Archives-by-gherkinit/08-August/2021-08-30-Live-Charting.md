I personally expect to test and fail 225.20 a break of that resistance could lead to an interesting week.

After Market

Looks like we leaned into that final day of consolidation but up 2% leaves us just a little short of today predicted low at 2.8%. The majority of today's volume was traded before noon. With a slow bleed out till the eod bounce. Thank you all for tuning in t+2 tomorrow has me pretty fucking jacked for a repeat of some of last weeks price action.

Edit 9 3:34

Low volume downward channel finally bounced at 207 possibly a bit of upside into close

Edit 8 1:51

So we bounced probably another test at 215 unlikely to cross without some volume, however

Edit 7 1:29

Unspectacular test at 215 failed again, look like an h&s but we could bounce on VWAP

Edit 5 12:37

Breaking out of consolidation a bit good sign for the rest of the day

Edit 2 10:07

Failed the test at 215 we will either form a head and shoulders and dip below VWAP or Bounce and retest.

Edit 1 9:52

Early breakthrough of 210 as predicted :), Volume is decent, but not great at 600k, If the trend continues I'm looking at 225 for the next significant test.

Pre-Market Analysis

Looks like they shorted as hard as they could at pre-market open, driving the price all the way down to 190 a quick recovery and a open gap fill up to 207 lead me to believe that a early test of 210 is definitely in the cards. After the obligatory morning short attack of course.

33k pre-market volume at 8:40 with 100k shares available to borrow.
