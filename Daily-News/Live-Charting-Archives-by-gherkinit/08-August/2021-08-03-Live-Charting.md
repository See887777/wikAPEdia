AFter Market

We'll we absolutely ripped in the last 15 minutes with 1.8M volume coming in and then seconds before close they shorted .5 million shares. Perfectly normal price action. But it's nice to see GME alive again. AH and PM should be interesting as the S&P 400 Rebalance plays out.

Edit 2 11:41

Still chopping along little lower but we had 5 tests of 150 before falling through a bit it's pretty clear that the SHFs are running out of breathing room and if the drop it to fast they will draw unwanted attention.

Pre-Market Analysis

Currently at 4k pre-market volume (new low?) had a little spike at open then back down to 157. Iborrow at 20k shares available. Liquidity in EU seems to be dropping off a few of my viewers have reached out to me about trouble filling orders with market orders taking 10-35 minutes to fill yesterday. This isn't proof of anything, obviously but it is curious.

Here is Where we sit after yesterday on the 1D for this weeks projected TA. The double bottom remains valid till there is a 5% difference in the low ( previous low was $151)
