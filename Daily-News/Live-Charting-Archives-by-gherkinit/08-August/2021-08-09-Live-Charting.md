After Market

I'm not gonna lie GME constantly closing with some variation of 69 in the price makes me feel like I'm in a simulation but here it is. Today was a bit odd there was some degree of ETF shorting going on but on GME itself no ITM puts and no shares borrowed only returned. If this continues tomorrow I will start to wonder why? Thank you all for tuning in see you tomorrow!

Intraday cup and handle? Idk real-time market manipulation is fun and there aren't gonna be any day-traders left on that third test of 164

Nice bounce off the completion of that head and shoulders heading back up and a little extra volume trickling in

Edit 3 10:48

RSI bottoming out at the 157 resistance volume still sub 1 million but it looks like we may be turning back around

Edit 2 10:03

Edit 1 9:50

196k volume in the first 20 minutes... but decent move upwards sitting above VWAP possibly moving in for a test at 157 albeit a very slow one

Pre-Market Analysis

Failed a test at 155 a little around 4am with 700k shares to borrow on Iborrow and 992k on Fidelity.

If we see some strong upward momentum they have 1.6m shares with which to short.
