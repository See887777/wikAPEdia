After Market

Had a nice up then sideways day that $10 dollar move today happened on 500k volume, looks good for the idea that bid/ask spread is gonna catapult this thing into the stratosphere on low volume...We also had a nice volume spike right at close. I'll be paying attention to performance in AH. Thank you all for tuning in see you tomorrow.

Edit 6 2:02

Found our way back above VWAP we are definitely well positioned on the current trend for another test of 170

Edit 5 11:55

Looks like some midday chop as the volume dries up, hopefully we can stay above VWAP

Edit 4 11:10

Failed that first test of 170 but have a decent bounce on VWAP moving in for another test. OI on call side is pretty stacked at 170 so the beginning of the ramp we would want to see 175 for that to start to be hedged

Edit 3 10:39

GME feelin' cute

Edit 2 10:17

Nice bounce off 159 possible test at 162.50, there is a 15k sell wall at 164

Edit 1 9:47

Nice double bottom opening, major indexes are down but GME staying pretty flat

Pre-Market Analysis

150k shares to borrow, volume below 4,000 shares traded...

all the TA you need for today can be found in¬†[yesterdays forward looking analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p53sln/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/)

Even with all that we have a solid shot at opening and testing 165 again looks like there is a decent amount of gamma exposure from last Thursday and Friday so more up on low volume is likely.
