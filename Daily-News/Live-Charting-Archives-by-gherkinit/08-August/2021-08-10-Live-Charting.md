Good Morning Apes!

Welcome to another day of not getting fleeced by our CEO. Remember when running a successful business you don't need to constantly lie to your shareholders and the shareholders of other companies to stay afloat. You can actually just keep your mouth shut and get shit done.

After Market

The big short attack today with the market dip drove us down a bit but we had a sold bounce at 155 and trended up for the rest of the day. The volume is still very low and until some interest flows back into the stock it is going to continue to be easy for the SHFs/MMs to manipulate the price. Thank you all for tuning in and I'll see you tomorrow.

Edit 4 2:52

Came back up to 157 but the volume is gone probably a slow sideways drift into EOD

Edit 3 11:33

Bit of a soft bounce at 158 they still have more shares to short but will probably save them for another downturn in the market

Looks like they are dumping those borrowed shorts along with the dip in the SPY

Pre-Market Analysis

Update forgot that borrowed shares 865k, and 32k volume

Gapped up in pre-market to test 166 and settled above yesterday's key resistance at 162.5 looking very good for an opening test of 170 after the obligatory short ? Hard to say, let us see if they continue to leave the stock alone for another day. I expect some volatility from leading statements by a certain "popcorn don" as he attempts to tie his failing business to Ryan Cohen's coattails. Since the number of GME/AMC related ETFs starts to narrow in scope the SHFs desire to see these stocks attached at the hip has never been more apparent.
