Good morning apes!

Another beautiful day of chart watching ahead of us. GME got hit with a pretty hard short to get it to close under 200 it drove right back up and stabilized there at market close. I expect a lot of yesterdays action was to get some of the gamma exposure off the market maker and longs taking advantage of the IV crush after the hard run. Most of the shorting that occurred happened on very low volume As call options poured in like crazy yesterday.

After Market

Closing out the day about a dollar down from my low estimate this morning. The volume is really throwing of the model 14m --> 10m --> 5m. Makes it hard to track but also shows a consolidation pattern. We may see a nice break out tomorrow but if shorts continue to be the only major purchasers of shares we won't see another large upside move until next mon/tue as they attempt to avoid what I can only describe as a big fucking gamma ramp. Thank you, see you tomorrow and have a good night.

Still waiting on volume after we broke down from 210 50k shares borrowed for that short attack maybe some run into the eod. Nice double bottom bounce opportunity.

Pre-Market Analysis

Not a lot of change to the technical indicators since yesterday morning as the price has remained about the same pre-market volume is still decent 31k so far with 50k shares borrowed and 100k available. Started to run at PM open hitting 203 before stabilizing around 200. Today should have more upside potential since so many calls were purchased during sideways trading yesterday. I think we have a potential gap fill from 205-210 depending on how we break at open. As always if media sentiment is neutral expect an opening short.
