Good Morning Apes!

Another season of fuckery is upon us, someone needs to look into t+12 (trading days) cause I swear we never have had a boring season finale.

So what the actual fuck happened at close yesterday?

People have speculated a things like :

Banging the Close: A manipulative or disruptive trading practice whereby a trader buys or sells a large number of futures contracts during the closing period of a futures contract (that is, the period during which the futures settlement price is determined) in order to benefit an even larger position in an option, swap, or other derivative that is cash settled based on the futures settlement price on that day.

While this is possible, although the issue I have being yesterday was not an expiration day for futures or options, it was most likely was the movement of shares from S&P 600 ETFs to S&P 400 ETFs we saw similar price action on 6/25/21 at EOD for the Russel 1000 move as did every other stock yesterday that was making the move to the 400 today.

Suffice to say today should be interesting with the move it is possible mutual funds and other entities that track the S&P 400 may be looking to enter a position especially at the current price point.

After-Market

I don't want to say that we have found our bottom but they spent quite a bit again today at 147 and even the downward gamma ramp only slipped it a couple bucks. We still have about $4 range to the downside but for now not dropping is a win in my book. Thank you all for tuning in, sorry the last couple days have been a bit slow. But, updating flat with a picture every 30 minutes seems silly. See ya tomorrow.

Edit 4 2:46

Trading at about the same price for over an hour now we slipped below those 150 puts for a bit but no a significant amount

Edit 3 11:55

Another bounce at 150, ITM options are coming in hot @ 160p and 200p there is a decent downward ramp at 150 so if we dip below we could slide a bit.

Edit 2 10:23

Failed the second test at 157 and dropped below VWAP again, volume really needs to pick up to nudge us higher.

Edit 1 9:51

Small breakout at open to fill that upper gap between 156-158 failed due to insufficient volume probably some chop now on VWAP

Pre-Market Analysis

Volume in Pre-Market is ok this morning sitting around 20k with 25k shares to borrow. This S&P 400 move could be beneficial to us today but we look like we are still following that bearish trend predicted in the weekly TA so we have some downside available to us. Don't forget if GameStop did move to new ETFs that means more options chains from which they could potentially short the stock vis delta hedging.

Nice gap to fill up at 156

Looks like we are right on track with that bearish trend from this weeks TA
