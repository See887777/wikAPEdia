Good Morning Apes!

Yesterday was kind of a wild ride, 66% of or volume yesterday was sell side with a net short carryover of 16%, that means that less than 300k shares purchased was enough to jump the price $10.

I expect or volume and volatility will pick up once again today as MM cover there gamma exposure from last Friday.

Additionally the longs are piling in this week ready to cover that short exposure with tons of call options this was the ratio yesterday. Like last Monday no significant number of ITM puts were purchased.

After-Market

Down a tiny bit today but we expected a few days of sideways the end of this week will be pretty important in determining our coming trend, especially as we approach the long term resistance. Thank you all for tuning in and I'll see you tomorrow morning.

Failed the bounce and then trended down with the spy falling into that correction indicator.

Edit 3 12:34

Volume is still dead but we finally had a bounce at support trending back up if volume picks up towards 1-2 we may see another upper resistance 165-167.50. GME starting to get a bit more volatile.

Edit 2 11:00

Failed the second test at 167.50 bounced of VWAP moving into test again. Now that @ Karl has chugged a bottle of rose on the discord the red in the stock should be sufficiently drunk away.

Edit 1 10:15

Failed a test at 165 at market open, chopped on VWAP for a minute and now moving in for a second test. Volume at 250k.

Pre-market Analysis

Slight dip at market open that looks like it is about filled back in. We are in a Descending wedge on the 15m timescale moving into opening bell that we hopefully will see break to the upside for another test of 170. Volume is low again this morning at 3k but yesterday's price action indicates that probably doesn't matter. Borrow rate is up to 1.0% with 150k shares borrowed this morning.
