Good Morning Everyone !

So yesterday's price action was far more volatile on the volume traded than I had anticipated so I have adjusted price expectations moving forward for the rest of this week. We appear to be moving about 60% more per million volume traded. Here is the update slightly less conservative price action.

After Market

Nice hard bounce into 200 at the EOD. Most of the day seemed to be an attempt to reduce OI on the options chain after the big run yesterday but we stayed well within that midpoint for the low prediction today bottoming out at 193. Also for those of you that have been here forever we closed the day out on a beautiful Carly Rae, Pepperidge Farms remembers the last time that happened :)

Doing a big short thing

Edit 9 2:43

Possible breakout on this wedge from the 15m, it's looking like MM are trying to decay theta to break down the gamma ramp but based on the call volume coming in it's just giving people a buy opportunity

Edit 8 1:36

Sitting in an uptrend from that bounce of 201 but the volume has yet to flow back in if it picks up I expect a breakout similar to yesterday if it doesn't flat and within that low-mid price action

Edit 7 12:25

Double bottom, midday volume is terribly low which gave some leeway to the shorts but I suspect more upwards action once more volume comes in after lunch

Still consolidating probably have a big move later in the day.

Looks like we have a confirmed bounce possibly another test of 225

225.20 looks like the new 180 consolidating a bit I expect a retest

Found a nice support at 193 turning around and back over $200

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Market volume at 150k with 70k shares available to borrow. Indicating another possibly higher volume day today than yesterday as we enter the second day of TTM squeeze the closest comparison I can find to our rate of movement is the previous run in January except now we are moving that amount on 15% of the volume. Trended down below 210 in the pre-market but it looks like we are coming back up into open. Possibly testing 225.20. Additionally, we may see an opening short attack to drive down sentiment from MSM and FOMO. I will be watching VWAP14 and EMA20/30 dips below VWAP should be considered decent dip buy opportunities.

Pre-Market 1m

CV_VWAP

Arbitrage is beginning to pick up. We are now triggering the inner signal line. A test of that outer red line indicates an incoming squeeze. I will be monitoring this throughout the day as arbitrage picks up due to price volatility.

MACD just beginning to pick up on the 1D. It has yet to even cross the breakeven indicating still more volume and volatility to come as we continue upward

Stochastic RSI

The trend on StochRSI (1D) just starting to cement itself in the uptrend D% still at 32.37 a very long way from oversold. This means our momentum should continue up for some time.
