Good Morning Apes!

Today after the regular stream I'm going to go live with Jaime from over at Tradespotting.

I'm pretty excited as he is more of a technical analysis guy like myself. So I'm hoping we can get more into the things I'm looking at for the near term, as well as his views on the direction the stock is taking.

Anyway it should be a good time check it out.

Edit 3 12:18

Did a poll on viewer ownership then extrapolated for the total number of subs on my channel. Used x , xx, xxx, xxxx, and xxxxx as values. Also up a little but volume is still to low to push past 157

Viewer Ownership 873 original votes, then estimates for 4000 and 8000 users

Edit 2 11:00

Now at 300k volume ignore the wedge it's from a different timescale still just chopping around 157

Edit 1 10:00

Getting dragged around by the market volume is at 160k in the first 30 minutes of trading

Premarket Analysis

220k shares borrowed back this morning. After yesterday's drop of 615k we have already retested 160 I'd imagine that position is gonna get locked up for a while. Pre-Market volume is absolute garbage at 4k currently, but we have a nice gap to fill back up to test 165. I would watch early run ups as they are obviously expecting to short again I'm sure they will wait for an advantageous market downturn.

We actually stuck the MACD crossover yesterday on the 1D, so any positive action today should continue that trend.

Here is how we are looking on our predicted positive trend, the low volume is keeping the price down but otherwise the trend is holding up. It's a bit ridiculous that it now takes 3 days to confirm a bounce on this stock but hopefully we will see some relevant volume today to really cement this trend.
