Good Morning Apes!

Another day, another impending market correction. GME dragged down by almost 1% in after hours with the S&P 500 down almost 80 points overnight. It looks like yesterday's FED minutes are being felt by the market.

I may have to step away at various points today to manage other positions, if that is the case I will still continue to update anything pertinent with GME. As usual in these "market correction" situations be prepared for a dip and it could be a steep one.

After Market

Closed up from that bounce actually looking pretty good for tomorrow. I'm not really sure about our price action tomorrow but the gamma ramp is pretty stacked all the way from 160 -200 so if we hit it and hit it hard we could run like crazy. Thank you all for tuning in and have a good night.

Edit 7 2:52

Small bounce at 150. Not a very strong reversal and the market continues to look weak

Small short attack and then no volume traded for 5 minutes

Edit 5 1:16

Trended back over VWAP looking like we could move in for another test of 157 volume however still awful @ 623k

Edit 4 12:25

Still sideways another failed test of VWAP. Gamma ramp brought down to 160

Edit 3 11:04

Rejected at the test of 157 but we are above VWAP now. If the market comes back up we should too as we tracked it closely on this move.

Edit 2 10:41

Our low volume today 325k, seems to be protecting us from larger moves in the market. I guess insulating is the right word...anyway sideways slightly below 155

Edit 1 10:15

Sorry for the delay. The Market is rebounding a bit. GME still trading between the 157 and 155 support/resistance levels

Pre-Market

With a market correction impending I have no idea what to expect as far as technicals go. We have nearly 14k volume right now and 150k shares available to borrow. We have already fallen a bit below the low support at 155 but it's possible we will regain that when the market opens. Below this we fall back to historical resistances at 152/150/147. 131 was our low the last time we were in this range. The gamma ramp is firmly in place and I expect it will be lowered to follow this downward price action.
