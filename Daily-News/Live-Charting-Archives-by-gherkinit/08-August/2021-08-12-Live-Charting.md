Good Morning Apes!

I wanna say thank you all so much for the support and compliments on the latest collaboration I did with Tradespotting. It was really fun I never get to talk to people in real life that way about GME and so I definitely had a blast.

Today looks promising if we can hold above that 162.5 trendline and confirm that bounce I will expect the next run up to begin. As we know every run-up could be our last. With bid/ask spread peaking at $24 yesterday I am still convinced of that violent upside potential.

After Market

Nice to have an actual green day looking very good on this continued uptrend since the bounce last week. A little more volume coming in today but the bid/ask is still wide and the stock remains illiquid. We are on a decent trajectory to end this week above max pain. Thank you all for tuning in and I'll see you tomorrow morning.

Edit 6 2:13

GME broke through that 162.50 resistance looks like some consolidation and then more up

Edit 4 1:00

Failed another test of 162 looks like we are bouncing off VWAP the trend is good but the volume is still garbage

Edit 3 11:00

Double bottom? maybe initial bounce failed on low volume I suspect this will too

Edit 2 10:42

Dropped off a really misshapen head and shoulders let see if we can get a confirmed bounce off 158 here to retest that 162 resistance

Edit 1 9:45

Nice opening bullflag looks like we might bounce on VWAP but that initial volume died off pretty quickly

Pre-Market Analysis

Holy shit pre-market volume at the time of writing this (8:10) is sub 2k shares traded. If this keeps we might be in for a sub 750k volume day. 200k shares left to borrow. Even with all that we are up about .61% in pre-market already having tested 162.

MACD is holding the crossover so far and looking like we are moving into higher volume and volatility

Lastly TTM Squeeze is showing 6 fire signals and BB KC is ready to explode.
