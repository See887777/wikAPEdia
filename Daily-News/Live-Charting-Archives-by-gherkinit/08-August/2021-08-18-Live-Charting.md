Good Morning Apes!

Yesterday ended a bit flat for the day but still within the parameters for our expected price movement this week. If we see a bit of volatility come in today that will be a good sign for the possible run on Thursday/Friday. If we remain flat GME will be looking at another test of that long term trendline.

After Market

The dip in the spy near close really dragged us down towards the end of the day. The FED minutes acknowledged high than estimated inflation and that seemed to cause some negative sentiment. The sideways movement today however was expected so we have not broken from the current price estimates. Thank you all and see you tomorrow.

Edit 8 3:37

SPY bouncing back, GME stalled right at VWAP hopefully the market turn around will give us a nice bounce before close

A little bit of volume finally coming in, moving up to test VWAP

Sideways Chop volume now at 978k

Still flat 900k volume now

Edit 4 12:01

Coming back up to VWAP back up and still holding that uptrend. 100k shares traded since the last update. If anything happens it will happen quickly, otherwise today is looking pretty flat.

Edit 3 11:06

The uptrend is continuing from that intraday low but the volume remains low currently at 600k most of which was from the earlier short attack. I'd like to see GME hold above VWAP here

Looks like a double bottom forming on the 1m

Edit 1 9:51

Nice morning short attack, dipping right down to the long term trend. But it appears they have only returned shares...

Pre-Market Analysis

Definitely looks like we are headed for the third day of opening 170 tests. Volume currently at 6k with 150k shares borrowed out of 300k available. The uptrend in pre-market is looking promising.

15m Timescale

Here is the options data from yesterday. Still call side favored but with 600k spent on ITM puts.

Lastly, Stochastic RSI had the expect K/D crossover after that false bearish signal I spoke about in the weekly DD. Looks like Momentum is on our side moving forward.
