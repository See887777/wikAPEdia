Good Morning Apes!

Yesterday's slight market correction didn't hurt as much as expected. But, it continues to remain unstable today with the S&P gapping down 40 points in the pre-market. The longs took advantage of the price dip yesterday and doubled down on the weekly gamma ramp dropping the entry point down to $160. If we do see some momentum today there is potential for a move. If the broader markets continue to hurt and our volume remains low I expect that we will complete that lower trend from last weeks DD.

After Market

Nice close up 4.19% on the day. We didn't really hit that gamma ramp on the last test of 160 but we managed to stay within expected price range for the week with a $1.10 margin of error for today's expected low. I have pretty high expectations for next week which I will discuss more in my Sunday DD. Thank you all so much for the support .

Edit 5 2:20

7k sell wall at 159 was smashed looks like the longs want this gamma ramp to play a bit on this breakout. Volume at 772k.

Edit 4 1:00

Little run up to test 158. Back down to VWAP looking for a turnaround and another push

Edit 3 12:02

Volume at 480k now trend back slightly above VWAP

Edit 2 11:29

Fell back below VWAP as expected volume no at 400k there is really nothing to talk a bout right now if volume doesn't pick up by 2pm the ramp is going to be rolled

Edit 1 10:22

The stock was moving so slowly I forgot to update... 200k volume multiple tests at 157 failed. GME will probably drop back down

Pre-Market Analysis

6k pre-market volume. 50k shares borrowed with 100k remaining. It looks like we are gonna be in for another slow day unless some volume comes in it will be difficult to break through any relevant resistances. The ideal outcome is that the shorts will not continue to be aided by the market decline and we can close out the day near max pain @ 165. If we do break 160 on some volume the gamma ramp is pretty spicy, but not guaranteed unless a significant amount of buy pressure comes in.
