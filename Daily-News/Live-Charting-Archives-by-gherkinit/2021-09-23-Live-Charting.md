Good Morning Apes!

After yesterday's little FED performance, and China's quick maneuvering to prop up their markets despite Evergrande's looming failure it looks like things are back on track to be bullish as hell. Hang Seng, Shanghai, and Shenzhen all closing decently up, the spy moving up in pre-market, hell even our favorite boy GME is up this morning in pre-market. The rug pull on the markets is likely coming but probably not today. GME still managing to stay above the long-term trend and is set up nicely for a bounce today, especially with the market turning around, we may be able to gain some ground back to $200-205.

After-Market

Pretty sideways day as expected and we trade under and near max-pain. More than half of today's 1.66m volume traded before 11:30am so our shot at pushing through 195 was defeated around then. The possible default by Evergrande could have an effect on the market's tonight, depending on how that shakes out tomorrow's action could be a dip or more sideways to close out the week. Thank you all for tuning in and I'll see you in the morning.

Edit 8 1:24

The volume is gone the only shorting going on is to prevent us from tracking the SPY literally every other stock is running today.

Edit 2 10:23

Nice break to the upside from this descending wedge, another test at 195, if we break it we could see some movement back towards 200.

Update on T+69*: we need at least 3.5M volume today to avoid FTDs tomorrow. Need 15M volume to avoid FTDs on Monday.

Edit 1 9:54

Nice bounce at open and then rejected at 195, based on the lack of volume it looks like we are gonna slump back down a bit. probably bounce on the EMA60

Pre-Market Analysis

8k volume in the pre-market could easily mean another 2m total volume day is in the works. 55k shares at IBKR and 773k from Fidelity. Plenty of shares to borrow with max pain currently at $195 I expect a small bounce up but just enough to track that long-term trend. Support at 190 held strong yesterday, seeing several bounces but we could see another dip to the 185 range if enough pressure is applied especially around midday when volume dies off.
