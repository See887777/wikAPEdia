Good Morning Apes!

Another day has arrived despite Burry say sensational shit he was unable to make his short positions print last night with the Shenzhen only .65% and SSE closing up .21% we may not see to much instability today. However tonight will be more telling with the Hang Seng being open simultaneously. I think we'll continue to see a choppy and unreliable market this week especially if nothing good comes out of today's FED meeting. If the market does stabilize a bit today is t+3 from the futures expiry and historically shows a little upward movement for GME. We'll see how that plays out vs. overall market trends.

*(this post will read from top to bottom)*

(*feel free to ask me questions below, but if you can google it yourself please use common sense)*

Historical Resistance/Support:

116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, 150, 152.5, 157 (previous ATM offering), 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172.5, 174, 176.5, 180.5, 182.5, 185, 187.5, 190, 192.5, 195, 196.5, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 225.20 (new ATM offering) 226, 232.5, 235, 242.5, 250, 255, 262.5, 275, 280, 285, 300, 302.50, 310, 317.50, 325, 332.5, 340, 350, 400, 483, moon base...

After-Market

Several spike between 190-192 basically all throughout the day GME is behaving in a very volatile manner even if that's occurring in a narrow price range. JPOW basically came out and said everything is fine and the FED is proceeding forward as expected...However I will be watching HS tonight to see if the Chinese markets have a different take on that. Either way closing green for the day is a nice positive given how much the market bounced around and the fact we only traded 2m volume. Thank you all, see you tomorrow.

Edit 6 2:51

Nice climb into the fed speech but it looks like the market wasn't too fond of the actual vs. expected graphs that CharPow's intern used coming down.

Edit 5 12:59

Nice bounce off 190 still no volume coming in but only 10 minutes from 12:69 a cross above VWAP would be nice stability going into the fed meeting.

Edit 4 12:20

Multiple fails of the upper resistance at 193 now a drop back to 190 fed meeting coming up could have an effect on the markets wild ride today so if it drops I could see us going down again.

Edit 3 11:00

Bounced off 190 and broke to the upside of this little bull pennant it looks like we might be losing some steam but the sell pressure is miniscule. We are up $6 from our low today on 800k volume.

GME looking good on low volume nice break right through 190

Edit 1 9:48

GameStop bouncing after the morning short moving up now with some other stocks like EXPR and SOFI. 200k volume.

Pre-Market Analysis

Starting pre-market off on 7k volume looks like another pretty slow day tbh. Oh, and somehow 500k shares were returned to Fidelity leaving borrowable at 875k (Fidelity) and 35k(IBKR), it constantly amazes me how this is done with 0 effect on the price. GME is up a tiny bit in pre-market just barely clinging to that long-term trendline around 191.

pre-market GME 1m

The S&P looking good in the AM again but it could easily come down like it did yesterday and drag us with it on low volume.
