Good Morning Apes!

Today is a bunch of things, quad witching, Friday, and most importantly of all the day futures contracts expire. It looks like if the intention for holders of any swaps or open futures contracts on GME were going to attempt to roll that yesterday was the last trading day to do so. While there is some confusion if today is the day they have to settle those contracts or not, whatever is open as of this morning will have to be settled by T+2 from today or Monday. With the gamma ramp still very much in place going into market open if settlement were to occur today the potential could be explosive. While quad witching's have been lackluster in the past. We have always gone into them with futures contracts rolled the week before, this cycle is currently not the same as the previous ones.

Well it looks like there was no covering of anywhere near expected volume for the settlement of futures contracts today. Remember that the settlement is still on the table until Wednesday,\
Sep 23rd, at the latest. I will cover this more in my DD this weekend. Thank you all so much for the support, and enjoy your weekend!

Pre-Market Analysis

10k pre-market volume so far with three hundred thousand borrowed from Fidelity this morning and 65k available on IBKR it looks like someone is getting set up to suppress some price movement. Much of the OI on the gamma ramp at least up to 250 has not been rolled forward or closed out so if we get some momentum expect that to help accelerate it. A little volatility at market open and plenty of room to the upside to test 210 this morning. It current looks like the 217.50 - 222.50 range is going to be the hardest to cross without decent momentum.
