After-Market and Earnings

Well we closed up the day right at 200 just shy of the gamma ramp. I still expect that significant covering must be completed by 6:15pm market time, tomorrow. Earnings were far better than expected while EPs came in slightly under expectations that loss per share was definitely outweighed by the positivity of what that money was used for;

-   3 confirmed new order fulfillment centers

-   A new customer service center here in the US opening in Florida

-   25% growth in quarterly profits

-   50% reduction in losses since this last year

-   New hires in the technology side of the business

-   Shit we didn't even lose money on the jet

-   NO FUCKING SHARE OFFERING !!!!

If the SHFs were banking on spinning this negatively they are gonna have a hard time. I honestly couldn't have hoped for a better outcome. They are spending money to turn this into the business we knew Cohen would create and are making massive leaps in that progress. Yes I saw the 10Q...

> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a "short squeeze."

Tomorrow should be an interesting day, thank you all for tuning in the amazing support and 10k subscribers, you have all been an amazing part of this journey for me and I will never be able to express the extent of my gratitude.

Failed that test at the trendline and are now sitting just under VWAP with lower volume

Crossing VWAP now... volume picking up

Edit 4 11:43

Uptrend breaking...well...to the upside. Bullish divergence is good. With T+69 indicating we should have 3-5 million volume today if that volume is buy side we could see some nice price action still

Edit 3 10:54

All they are effectively doing right now is allowing the gamma ramp to drop even lower, calls at 205/200/195 rolling in now

Edit 1 9:49

Quick test of 205 failed out of the gate either volume dies for the rest of the day or we bounce off this short attack and try again

Pre-Market Analysis

Volume currently at 24k with another hour till market open this actually looks pretty good. However the shorts are definitely ready to stamp out any FOMO that may come in with earnings. There are 235k shares borrowed this morning and another 818k available between Fidelity and IBKR. We still have an unfilled gap around 211-214 which could be relevant if we start climbing. The shorts really put themselves in a tricky position yesterday by not holding the price up at 210 a little better. Allowing long funds and retail to buy cheap weeklies in the 200-215 range further filling in the low end of that gamma ramp.
