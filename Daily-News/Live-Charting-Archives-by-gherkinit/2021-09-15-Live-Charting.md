Good Morning Apes !

Today is is the first day of the new supplement liquidity deposit changes. So don't forget that the DTCC says to be careful out there cause there may be margin calls. Additionally today marks IMM rollover day which is the rollover for foreign exchange traded futures. How much either of these will effect GameStop is up for debate but I suspect very little. I'm still waiting to confirm action on my thesis for futures rollovers in the next 5 trading days.

After Market

Well that slow drift up with the S&P had us closing just at the resistance of 205. There still seems to be some confusion with trading vs. settle vs. expiry on these futures rolls but\
I can say the latest apparent date currently is the 23rd. I will do some more research tonight to narrow that down and update everyone in the morning before opening bell. Thank you all so much for tuning in and have a good night.

Still just tracking the market with 1.5m volume traded, we are going up but as slowly as possible

Sorry for the delay but I was working on some information regarding the futures contract settlement it looks like the final trading day was the tenth and according to this T+3 from that day is today. Also up.

Edit 3 11:39

Coming back up from a bounce slightly above VWAP I think we definitely have a bit more run left today buy side orderbook is picking up a bit of steam.

Edit 2 11:00

Nice little run to a rejection at 203 looking for a recovery to continue the uptrend

Edit 1 9:50

Opening drop into a reversal at 195 looks like we are filling that small gap to 200

Pre-Market Analysis

A little borrowing going on from fidelity in the pre-market this morning looks like there are about 745k shares available between IBKR and Fidelity. GME trading a bit lower than close right now, and on track to hit 195 likely due to the market also dropping in the AM. There is a little gap to fill to the upside but it with 16k shares traded in the pre-market it looks like it will have a weak open.
