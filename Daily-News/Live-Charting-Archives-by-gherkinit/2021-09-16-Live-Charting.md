Good Morning Apes!

So after a bunch of digging last night I sort of ended where I started on the whole furthest date out that this cycle could be defeated. It looks like 9/23 is that last possible settlement date to cover (this covers all t+2 delivery windows). While it's possible nothing happens by that date, it does not mean that futures contracts are dead in the water. It just means that they have either covered it in a way we had not predicted or they did not need more than the number of shares they received via ETF rebalancing and the ATM offer.

After Hours

Another up day going into futures expiry tomorrow it is likely today represents the last day that rolling was an option. Normally I would think we are gonna close the week at max pain tomorrow with little movement but the ramp was not significantly rolled today and many more contracts were still coming in for tomorrow so at least big money is expecting moves and or forcing the shorts to let any open contracts expire. Thank you all for tuning in, see you in the morning!

Edit 7 2:22

Still consolidation after falling through the EMA but holding above VWAP is goof moving into power hour. The longs still seem very committed to buy calls for tomorrow as contracts are still being opened for the 17th.

Edit 6 1:45

Slight breakdown from a triple top the gap from 215-220 could be hard to close without some volume. Hopefully we can bounce on the EMA60

Pre-Market Analysis

The SPY is coming down in premarket again so given our 7k pre-market volume on GME we may be in for another day of getting dragged around by the S&P. Looks like there are 640k shares available to borrow between IBKR and Fidelity. Even given that GME doesn't look to bad this morning hit it's low and looks like it's turning around for a test of 205 in the early part of the day.
