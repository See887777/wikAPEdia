Good Morning Apes!

Today should be a good one while I wasn't able to find the MM data I needed in time to see the amount of gamma exposure MM's were sitting on today, there really is no better evidence than watching it play out on the chart.

So what do I expect today?

We fell short of the test at 225.20 I expect today will be different. If we can get enough momentum to break out the potential upside is pretty high.

After Market

Came down with the market near close and had a nice run to close out the day. Closing price at 218.24 put us nicely in the mid range for the expected price today, but was honestly not the amount of volume and price action I was expect leaving us trading still below that long-term trend line as we struggle to break that 225 barrier. The MM have till market open tomorrow to cover the t+2 from last Friday so I will be watching for a hard run in AH and PM. Thank you all for tuning in.

Edit 8 2:22

Pushing up through VWAP, still only 400k volume traded in the last 2 hours, I think maybe they are waiting till AH to cover t+2 due to the ETF rebalance coming in?

Still consolidating in the same 3 dollar range we were 2 hours ago

Edit 4 11:32

Little bounce off resistance after this drawn out consolidation period, might be time to start moving if we can cross VWAP

Edit 3 10:33

Slow ascending channel volume is starting to pick up a bit as we approach 225.20 remember we are really looking for a break of that long term trend at 224.20.

Edit 1 9:44

Volume at 300k nice uptrend immediately above 215, consolidating a bit and then hopefully another push up

Pre-Market Analysis

Consolidated from a test at 215 earlier this morning. 12.5k volume with 100k shares available to borrow. Light pre-market volume could mean a slow morning and possibly a dip at open. The market looks like it's sagging into open as well so if our volume remains low expect that to effect us today.

pre-market 1m

The signal line on the MACD just crossed over zero so theoretically we should be seeing some increased volume and volatility coming in over the next few days.
