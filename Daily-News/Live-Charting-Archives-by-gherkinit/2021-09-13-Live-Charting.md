Good Morning Apes !

Absolute rip this morning in German market. I expect some more similar action leading into 9:30pm in the pre-market. If the SHFs want to price retail/and longs out of the options chain there best bet is to move the price hard and early to spike IV. This could be difficult if they can't get enough liquidity in the pre-market.

After Hours

Burry tweets and rips it's been a good one with steady growth throughout the day. I definitely was looking for them to spike IV but it's possible the gamma ramp is to daunting. Tomorrow marks t+2 from the massive $200 put position that was closed last Friday so I expect we will see some action on that front. There current strategy should be to try to bleed the gamma ramp till late Wednesday or Thursday and then cover, or they are fucked and will be forced to cover after the contract expires, or I'm a complete idiot and there are no futures contracts. Only time will tell. Thank you all for tuning in. See ya tomorrow.

RIpping? Also Burry's 13b reference might be the FTC rule 13b

Edit 6 12:55-12:69

Longs are buying in hard at ITM strikes 140-160-190-195 all with increased OI in the last hour looks like they are gonna push their ramp even if the shorts don't want to. All the money from the gamma ramp for these last 6 weeks has been rolled out to the 17th, This is definitely showdown time!

Edit 5 12:35

Continuing this uptrend back to 200 as slowly as possible, definitely some of the BARR effect as we see the price climbing with much more stability

Edit 3 10:07

Light rejection at $200 a bounce on the EMA 20 would lead to a second test pressure is solid but the volume is low

Broke away from the 195 resistance towards the start of that ramp at $200 ...more up

Quick run to 195 then a SPY dump dragging us down let's see if some of that free capital comes our way

Pre-Market Analysis

Edit 1: Fidelity now at 1.280M shares to borrow

German market took off like crazy this morning (well crazy for the German market at least) hitting a test of 195 right out of the gate. We still have a solid gap to fill up to 200. However the shorts have already borrowed around 250k shares this morning or 3.2million depending on how accurate Fidelity's data was. With IBKR showing 5k to borrow and Fidelity showing 533k. Although I checked fidelity last night and the 3.6 million additional shares seemed to have disappeared.

pre-market on the 1m

I'll be checking CV_VWAP at open for signs of arbitrage with that big of a bounce in the German Market we may see some.
