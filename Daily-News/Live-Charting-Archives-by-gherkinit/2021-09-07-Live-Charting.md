After-Market

That was a flat day. Didn't even get our standard run at the end of day to close out the gap. I still expect they have a significant amount of FTDs to cover in the next couple days. The crunch here between expected price action and earnings is getting very tight. There is a possibility that they are waiting till after earnings to cover futures rollovers on the hope that earnings are bad. But either way they have a lot of buying to do in an increasingly shorter period of time. Thank you all for watching and reading along, see you tomorrow.

Edit 8 2:40

call volume pouring in while we remain flat at 200...probably move up right before close for a neutral day

Still chopping at the $200 resistance

Edit 6 11:22

Big short driving us all the way down under $200, I'm not sure if this is a last ditch effort or they are simply taking advantage of the market decline.

Edit 5 11:08

Crypto is tanking and the market looks like garbage today but our volume is gone to lunch most likely won't see a lot of action till this afternoon.

Edit 1 9:47

Failing the double top test at 210 volume is kind of low right now 360k

Pre-Market

25k volume traded with 858k shares available to borrow (Fidelity + Iborrow). I think we could see a test of 205 in the pre-market maybe even moving into a test of 210. I expect some pretty serious movement before and into opening bell in order to price out weekly options as we move into earnings.
