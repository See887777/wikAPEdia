Good Morning Apes !

Today could be an interesting one. With T+5 remaining on the futures contracts and GME trading steadily at $200 we really have the potential to see a break of that upper 350 resistance. The real question today is will the long HFs roll the gamma ramp forward and let us trade flat on the day or hold it and stockpile 0DTE options and take us to the moon? The SHFs will likely continue to slam the price with near ITM puts like they did yesterday when they piled into 9/10 $200p's. Either way the battle for this crucial resistance wages on.

After Market

Slow bleed into the end of the day just under max-pain. If the SHFs intend to cover next week to satisfy whatever futures fuckery the plan on. This was their best strategy, shaved off 1000s of OI from the gamma ramp and can run the price in the early part of next week while weekly options are pricier. Thank you all for tuning in, have a good weekend.

Failure of the triple top at 195 back to mean before a possible bounce

Bullish break will confirm if we cross 195 right now

Edit 4 11:24

Looked like a big block sale of about ~350k shares most of it reported via OTC exchange bounced on 190

Nice descending wedge breakout to re-test 200

Edit 1 9:48

Opening with a small dip into a double bottom if some volume picks up we could break through $200

Pre-Market Analysis

With 20k volume in the pre-market and 1.03m shares to borrow between Fidelity and IBKR the pre-market looks a little dull max pain at6 197.5 is definitely the goal for MMs today but a breakout over 210 could really see the gamma ramp take off.
