Good Morning Apes!

The Market is coming back a bit this morning, up .71% from close yesterday, but with China's Market re-opening tomorrow we may see more instability in the latter half of the week. Today is T+2 from all those ITM calls on Friday, a large number of calls were likely exercised between the 160, 170, 195 and 200 strikes some of that gamma exposure should be covered today. Additionally today is T+2 from the futures expiry date. I expect we could see some effect from this but for a better idea of my current¬†[working thesis check out this video.](https://youtu.be/F68fQLHn0Zo)

Strong dip into close as the it appears nobody wanted to carry the S&P overnight. We could see some major downside tomorrow if Chinese markets tank tonight. Should be some nice dip buy opportunities. Thank you all for tuning in, see you tomorrow.

Nice rally up to 193 then right back down again this time shorting not because of market action

Coming in for another test at 190, little more volume on this

130k shares returned to IBKR causing a small run to another failed test at 190

Edit 6 12:47

GME trending down after a decent short to push us back from that resistance test. Also, SPY forming a big head & shoulders looks like we might see a dip soon.

Edit 5 12:00

Testing 190 but volume drying up at the resistance

Edit 4 11:38

SPY coming back just crossed VWAP, we'll see if it can hold support. GME turned around on 186 and coming up a little. They market is just dragging us around with only 1.47m volume today.

Edit 3 11:13

Found some support at 187, the S&P struggling to regain it's foothold above the 435 correction zone.

Edit 2 11:00

Spy dropping again GME following suit looks like another down day

Edit 1 9:45

Morning short turning around with the market just surging looks good for some upside movement if we ge the volume to break through resistances

Pre-Market Analysis

Yesterday's dips left us with a couple gaps to fill up to 204. Fidelity and IBKR sitting on 375,187 shares to borrow, clearly showing the shorts took advantage of yesterdays market dip in order to bring the price down just a little harder. 11.63k shares traded so far in the pre-market indicates we are in for a moderately low volume day. Our move back up into close yesterday put us right back above our long-term trend however so the effect was nominal and positioned us well for a bounce.

GME pre-market 1m

SPY is coming back as well moving up towards it's 60EMA if it can cross back over 439.71 today we could see it surge upwards for the rest of the day.
