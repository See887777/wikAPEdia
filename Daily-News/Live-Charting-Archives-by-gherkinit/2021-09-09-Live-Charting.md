Good Morning Apes!

So the day is upon us earnings were solid despite what MSM might want you to think. 25% growth is fucking insane. Enjoy the tasty dip this morning for it may be your last.

On another note, futures contracts must be rolled between 10am and 6:15pm today and the gamma ramp still stands. The SHFs if they need to cover net loss before rolling these contracts have today to do so. Traditionally this has required lots of buying. I assume the current shorting is an attempt to give themselves as much headroom as possible because from what I can see they are gonna need it.

Fuck yes! GME's first green day post earnings ! Eat a dick MSM, if we moved on... why so up? Ok but seriously the discovery today that they could delay the known run up to 9/17 was a huge break thank you to my quant team for digging that up amazing work guys! Thank you all so much, I'll see you tomorrow.

Edit 5 12:42

Comparison of 8/24 with today, when they covered quarterly options rollover

Edit 4 11:55

It looks like they have until 9/17 to cover any futures exposure this cycle so it looks like they bumped the rollover so they could short earnings before they begin the cycle of covering. So they still have 6 trading days to cover the expected run up

Edit 3 11:24

Still testing and failing 185 but the trend for the day is still up if we run we could very quickly fill the gap up to 195-200

Edit 2 10:25

We keep trying to take off from 180 but keep getting slammed down again today looks like it's gonna be a struggle for a bit

Edit 1 9:48

Push up against that long term trend but we seem to be holding. Futures contracts come due in 12 minutes. I don;t know if that effect will be immeadiate or not but holding this resistance is good . 1M volume traded.

Pre-Market Analysis

Volume is already at 80k in the pre-market with 705k shares available to borrow from Fidelity and IBKR. I expect the will dip as hard as they can before 10am to scare longs out of options before they have to begin covering. Today's gonna be a wild ride if nothing else also this is the lowest drop post earnings we have seen this year. Let's go trap some bears...

Arbitrage is pretty significant this morning already crossing the 1st signal line
