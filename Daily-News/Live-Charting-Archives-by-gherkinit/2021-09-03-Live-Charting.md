Good Morning Apes!

Yesterday marked our first day without a single attempt at crossing 220 let alone a test at 225. While most of the gamma ramp is rolled forward enough OI still exists in 0DTE's for today for us to see some serious push if we can cross 225. Here is today's expected price action. Yet again we are looking to cross 225 to really get this gamma ramp off the ground.

After Market

Regulations didn't seem to have much effect today. Shorted down to just above max pain on pretty low volume. But we still closed above max pain. I'm still looking for a pretty strong run moving into earnings but am pretty impressed with their continued ability to suppress the price this week. Thank you all and I will see you Tuesday morning. Have a great weekend!

This bounce off 198 is looking solid some more volume coming in we may see a small push in power hour. Max pain at 200.

Some serious volume shorting driving us down towards max pain

Edit 5 12:40

Back down to 205 volume at 1.35m for the day, more chop until at least this afternoon, but it looks like the standard up, down, and up at close day to have us trade net 0% for the entirety.

Edit 4 12:05

Bounced off resistance to end sideways at 207, This is an ideal range for the SHFs to throw some of the weeklies off the gamma ramp. I wouldn't expect any serious movement until more 0dte calls have been sold or rolled.

Edit 2 11:00

No significant price action test of 215 standard volume drop and downtrend settling on 210 now

Edit 1 9:44

Low volume but moving up for a nice morning test of resistance @ 215

Pre-Market Analysis

Today marks two changes to DTCC regulations

1.  Collateral Requirements Raised from 10k-250k, I don't think this will have much of an effect as it is per/participant and not per account

2.  T+2 from when certain federal backed securities will no longer be accepted for GCF Repo transactions, this could have big implications for current accounts using these securities for Collateral Allocation Requirements

Volume this morning at the low for the week so far at 10k shares traded with 1.03m available to borrow between Fidelity and IBKR. We have stayed fairly stable throughout pre-market trading right around our closing price. I expect we could see another test of 225 currently it doesn't look like the volume will come in for that too happen. The SHFs really appear to be pushing their FTDs to the very edge this time around attempting to cover them all at once presents them with some serious risk but I suppose I'd be scared shitless of that gamma ramp if I were them too.
