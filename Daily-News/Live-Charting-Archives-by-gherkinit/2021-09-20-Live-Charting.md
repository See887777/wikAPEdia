Good Morning Apes!

I've said this before but I'm gonna say it again, GameStop could dip pretty hard today the S&P has already dropped 150 points in the pre-market if that downward price action continues we could see sell offs from paper-handed investors.

But, with GME's negative beta and retail holding multiples of the float GME could quickly become an attractive investment for institutions during this drop. Additionally GME has no long-term debt and lots of cash on hand, Cohen has prepared GME well for this.

Lastly SHFs core positions are dropping hard enough that we could see margin calls come in.

Enjoy the dip buy opportunities and let the diamond handing commence.

After Market

Spy and GME both moving up into close today. If we see the spy jump back above that resistance at 435 it may signal at least a break from the correction, although we could see more impact on Wednesday when the Chinese markets are open. Overall not nearly as bad a dip as I expected and we got back over the long-term trendline be EOD which is definitely bullish. Thank you and see you all tomorrow.

Edit 5 2:39

Market still coming down breaking below that 430 support, GME also down but it looks like it is holding at 185 for now. We've broken through that long-term trendline and have more support down at 180.

Edit 4 1:32

Still tracking the spy our volume isn't terrible but it's not enough to push us away from the market trends

Edit 2 10:36

slightly above the $200 resistance holding strong, market looks like it's trying to bounce back a bit as well.

Edit 1 9:50

GME holding the line at $200 but the spy is struggling to bounce back and still looking very choppy.

Pre-Market Analysis

GME down $10 in the pre-market already. About 500k shares left to borrow on Fidelity/IBKR. I expect the SHFs to take full advantage of this dip. Our next significant support is down at 190 on the long term trendline. Below that there is support at 180. Any lower and I will update with next best support in each post today.

pre-market GME on the 1m

On the SPY we have fallen right below the EMA60 signifying that we are in a correction the next resistance is at 425 and 420 with the 200MA sitting at 409.34 a dip below that trend could imply a significant sell-off or possible crash.
