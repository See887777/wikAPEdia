Good Morning Apes!

Let hope we see more continued action today after yesterdays 6.8%+ close. With the gamma ramp shifting up slowly as more and more calls pile in a surge in volume past 210 could really kick this off. Today we also have T+2 settlement from last Friday, In order to fight for max pain lots of puts were purchased Friday the 10th to drive the price down. This and still expected volume from futures rollover continues to give this week a lot of promise.

After-Hours

Weird fight right at market close for 200 with a chunk of volume coming in on the first couple ticks of the hour. Pretty much nothing today, dragged down by the market which is hitting it's 7th red day in row and while inflation was down today it was not significant. I'm still watching for a spicy AH for this week if we are to expect and significant movement. Thank you for tuning in, see you tomorrow.

Edit 6 1:30

SPY turning back around a bit and we are coming up with it but as long as our volume is this low I expect we'll be pretty flat for today. Double bottom bounce testing VWAP

Edit 5 12:28

Flat with no volume. We are positioned well for another test but it looks like we may not see volume till later this afternoon

Volume picking up green on the day now and testing 205

Bounce off 197.50 after that failed double bottom breakout. RIP Feces the goldfish

Double bottom on VWAP if we hold the resistance

Edit 9:50

Morning short down to 195 lead to a nice bullish reversal, test at 205 and 210 are key for today

Pre-Market Analysis

9k volume traded so far this morning, Fidelity and IBKR with 775k available shares with ~250k borrowed this morning so far. Basically no pre-market movement if I am correct they are gonna drag this out as long as possible to relieve pressure from that ramp. I suppose their goal with t+2 is going to be to cover as slowly as possible, with the longs buying ITM calls like yesterday to push the price up however this covering could get the ball rolling.
