It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Wake up, take care of the "3 S's", get ready for work that hopefully you won't have to go to SOON^TM

This maybe a little out of order but here is a Meme to start us off!

[Reverse Repo broke $1T again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p1tqgj/daily_reverse_repo_update_0810_998654b/)!

Aaaaand there you have it folks. The system is at $1T and if the growth of it stays the same it will just go up from here.

In the event my goldfish brain forget here isÂ [Reverse Repo explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owwk1p/the_rrp_number_is_incredible_but_what_does_it/h7iv86i/?context=3)Â in a way even I can understand.

[Treasury is at $416B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ozecaq/daily_treasury_balance_update_for_0805_466b_39b/)

Looks like a drop of $28B. I guess they spent way too much money looking for that $2B yesterday. Private consultants aren't cheap.

[Lowest Volume seems like someone accidently pressed Mute](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p2kzi0/i_cant_hear_you_closed_with_091_mil_volume_sub1/)

[US Inflation Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p2cou7/us_inflation_chart_update/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

The last time that inflation has 3 consecutive months in the 5% range was June, July, and August of 2008. The crash then happened on September 29. Like all TA this is not an indicator of a crash but there is a strong correlation of the power of the dollar skyrocketing, weakening economic power, and a stock market crash.

[Hop on this post because we are going Cycling!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p21f5x/cycles_dtccnscc_stuff/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

There is a ton of information within this post. It is a decently long read.Â [u/Leenixus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Leenixus/)Â highlights cycles on calendars. Breaks out what the cycles are in concise language and plots out potential TA repetition. No specific dates just a bunch of dates with colors on them.

Barbara Streisand and Beyonce could teach the hedgies a thing or two about "deleting things" from the internet or asking for people not to look. Looks like we have a new spot to dig! If anyone has any updates on this please tag me!

[Looks Like CNBC wants GG to be the Enemy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p20gp2/save_this_for_your_records_here_is_cnbc/)

Looks like they are trying to control a narrative. I wonder if they will be investigated in the near future. Time to start getting some kettle corn ready!
