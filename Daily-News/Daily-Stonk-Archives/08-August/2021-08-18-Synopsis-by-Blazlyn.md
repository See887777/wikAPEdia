Looks like mommy gave them some milk money! +27B

Tick tock on the way to $0 although this doesn't necessarily mean a [real balance of $0](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p5sv1z/correction_the_us_treasury_is_not_running_out_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share>) it does act as a reliable indicator. Especially if it doesn't last to Q4.

#[Algorithms are Cyclical](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p601la/algorithmic_cycle_theory_looking_bullish_day8/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share>)

"This daily tracker is testing the theory that algorithmic price manipulation is cyclical. The cycle length between the last two price rips could be an insight into the backend of market maker's algorithmic manipulation, as well as our current position in the cycle."Â [u/fleshfarm-leftover](https://www.reddit.com/u/fleshfarm-leftover/)

"SEC can issue an emergency order. First order aimed to stop all FTD's by reducing the cycle to three days, and to prevent continued short selling if you had outstanding FTD's. The second order straight up banned short selling. They then put out a series of highly directed questions to get feedback on how to best target those responsible for the abusive naked short selling."Â [u/go-do-that-thing](https://www.reddit.com/u/go-do-that-thing/)
