It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Remember the fundamentals that our parents told us BUY and HODL. Grab you coffee or drop trau. It is time for the last two day's recap! There was a little brouhaha with Mr. AutoMod and my post was "removed" and I wasn't able to re-post it.

Looks like rebuilding a company takes time. It also takes vision and gusto. Good fundamentals, adaption to technology and leadership = BUY and HODL.

"Brick by brick, my fellow citizens, brick by brick." This quote is originally attributed to Emperor Hadrian, who allegedly said it while urging his people to re-build Rome after a horrific fire, encouraging them to do so in a methodical manner so that it may stand the test of time.

Some possible DD into links of Point 72 and GME. Point72 is using Grayscale/Coindesk to manipulate c r y p t o with the help of Cathie Woods of ARK to gain infinite leverage to continue to short GME and avoid margin call.

[Financial Hot Potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p73nx2/they_see_me_accountin_they_hating_a_look_into/)

Citadel sets it own terms for transactions between different broker dealer businesses they operate. They use reverse repurchase and repurchase agreement and use securities received to cover short position. Terms of those agreements between the affiliated parties might be of material difference. I haven't seen much attention given to this topic but the financial statements seem to point in that direction.

Thank you to the mod team!! Thank you to YOU ALL BEAUTIFUL APES!

Remember not to to give your password or log in information to anyone. If it seems suspicious don't do it! Phishing attacks have become more common across all platforms.

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries. This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. We help each other, we care for each other. Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

Okay that is all for now smell ya later!
