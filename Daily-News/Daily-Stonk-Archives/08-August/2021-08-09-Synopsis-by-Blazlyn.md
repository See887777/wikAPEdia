It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Get up off your butt, do 3 sets of 5 pull ups, flex into the mirror and say "GAWDDAMN I'M a sexy BEAST!"

[Reverse Repo is just chilling there under $1T](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ozb3u3/daily_reverse_repo_update_0806_952134b/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

In the event my goldfish brain forget here isÂ [Reverse Repo explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owwk1p/the_rrp_number_is_incredible_but_what_does_it/h7iv86i/?context=3)Â in a way even I can understand. If it keeps doing this I may have to grow a wrinkle and write something new here....

[Treasury is at $466B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ozecaq/daily_treasury_balance_update_for_0805_466b_39b/)

Looks like a drop of $39B. I wonder where it will be after the weekend!

[Last night Gold and Silver both took a nosedive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p0oyp6/gold_with_a_fast_drop/)

Usually these are indicators of someone liquidating assets. I wonder if Marge dropped a friendly text prior to calling someone. The crypto market also tanked. I wonder if there will be news today of some bank dropping/closing/restructuring.

[Watch this video and grow some wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p0le8y/posting_this_everyday_until_moass_because_hedgies/)

Through the dark side of the looking glass. I made it part way through before pizza got here last night and I got distracted. I will do my best to finish it today. Y'all should do the same. It is a lot like a college lecture except you can rewind and aren't reliant on notes from that one kid who will tell you wayyyyyyyyyy too much personal information.

[A GME in hand is worth two to Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p0lmzw/how_to_direct_register_shares_for_infinite/)

That is that classic saying right? A time tested strategy against speculation. Count what you have on hand and let that be your true worth. If you want a cool piece of paper for the infinity pool here are some instructions for different brokers.

[SEC is dropping Millys](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-146)

Dolla dolla bills to some more whistleblowers. Does anyone have a total yet? I wonder if they will buy GME come market open? I wonder how much information GG is getting from the people who wereÂ ~~paid off~~Â rewarded back in January.

[Let's Tie Together a Year of Economics and Pandemics!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p0n06y/covid19_the_cares_act_and_undeniable_greed_the/)

PPP money was used to pay off companies that were short GME and not actually for the people. (surprised Pikachu) Great charts and tablesÂ [u/Freadom6](https://www.reddit.com/u/Freadom6/)Â In summary: "31 companies invested in GME receivedÂ $24.37 MILLION. At that time, with share prices under $5..." Tick Tock there Kenny and the Shorties.

I apologize for no pictures and being brief. It was a long weekend... Keep in mind I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor. All this is just some silly school boy writing on a desk.
