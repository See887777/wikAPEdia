It is time for [The Daily Stonk](https://preview.redd.it/h5yz344z4qe71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=030ec1b2a90085e5a71eb5246f3edf714fd2e331)

Now as many of you know [/u/vice1337](https://www.reddit.com/u/vice1337/) stepped down yesterday. Thank you for all that you and your team did to bring us the news. Good luck with everything!

Today's post will be a little short but that is something we're all used to. I have been messaging a few other people and we are building a communication network and will get some information flowing. Please bear with us over the next few days while we work out a system! We will try to limit the bull!

Please feel free to tag me in any verified information or any story that is developing!

Yesterday the 22 politicians were revealed who voted against the transparency of their trading. [/u/Same-Tour9465](https://www.reddit.com/u/Same-Tour9465/) posted the [confirmed list here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovr6ct/passed_barely_short_sale_transparency_and_market/h7bauij/)

Do not send hate mail. Apes don't fight apes and apes work within the system. Once it is smashed then we can start over. That being said: If you live in one of these districts please take the time to write a letter to your representative. Do not do this if you are not in their district. The aides read those and pass on the message. If they get enough from THEIR constituents they MAY make a change. For those outside the district continue to submit to the SEC and hopefully we have as much luck with them as OU and Texas with the useful SEC.

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.
