It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Crack open a cold one, eat some junky food and and prop your feet up you other side of the world Apes! Murica just woke up.

It is time for [The Daily Stonk](https://preview.redd.it/h5yz344z4qe71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=030ec1b2a90085e5a71eb5246f3edf714fd2e331)

[S&P mid-cap 400 today!!!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/07/27/gamestop-is-coming-to-an-index-fund-near-you-a-new-stage-in-the-stock-markets-hallucinogenic-trip/amp/) Even Forbes is talking about us. What does this mean? Well it means that we have a solid company that has true potential. So like our parents kept telling us: Find a good stock and hold onto it.

[Reverse Repo is sitting there just under $1T still](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owjfqi/daily_reverse_repo_update_0802_921317b/) I'm not sure I truly grasp it.... If anyone has some data on what this number really means please point me in the direction with an explanation like you're talking to [this fine man.](https://tenor.com/view/wumbo-spongebob-gif-10902129) Best I can figure is that is how much money the baby corporations owe the daddy corporations for some zipple.

Gary Gensler of the SEC states the SEC has authority over the crypto space. He stated he needs resources and support from congress and for them to act to protect the system from bad actors. His proposed order of importance for pursuing regulation: crypto trading, lending, and DeFi platforms.

GameStop is on notice Gary Gensler and the SEC is watching. Good thing GameStop is comprised of a hardworking team working on the up and up to do by right by their customers.

Ethereum was debunked for reasons of pure speculation and making numbers work on voodoo. Also I forgot to delete it from yesterday's copy paste.... Don't squat and post boys and girls

[Looks like we've got some indicators to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owe33g/sp_smallcap_to_midcap_shift_everything_you_need/)

If my smooth brain translates this correctly there will be some sideways trading on all of these little pools of stocks. They will come with a little bit of a dip if we hold to the principal of all good news comes with a dip. But again good company with strong fundamentals. Hold onto them like daddy said. [Expect a dip today as some smart people with wrinkles conducted a study about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ox9ogs/actual_price_impact_of_moving_from_sp_smallcap/)

[Exponential floor guy final update 😭❤️🦧](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ox39kn/0802_final_update_floor_guys_log_stonkdate_306/) [u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/) gives their final update on the now-defunct exponential floor model--the model is broken but their resolution is stronger than ever! [Apes all across the jungle applaud your efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxfxl0/thank_you_for_your_service_good_ape/) (and all the other TA 'guys') in attempting to use technical tools to rationally read the tea leaves of this blatantly manipulated stock by irrational actors.

[I always love rollercoasters in the last minute of a football game. Why should stocks differ!?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxbo19/the_last_5_minutes_of_market_today_was_all_the/)

Apparently this little maneuver is called [banging the close](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxdd1x/dear_sec_on_8321_gme_stonk_was_blatantly/). Oh my goodness what a rush that was! Good thing GG isn't watching or anything. We also have our best [mathematical geniuses working on what this means](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ox5zkx/according_to_my_precise_calculations_were_just/) in the long run!

I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor. All this is just some yank's opinion who's brain is as smooth as his head.

Thank you to the mod team!!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries. This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. We help each other, we care for each other. Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Okay that is all for now adios buckaroo
