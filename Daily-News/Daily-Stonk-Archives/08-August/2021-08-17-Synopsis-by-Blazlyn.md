[NYSE Securities List is The Streissand Effect Incarnate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p5u6g5/shfs_and_mms_are_coordinating_to_keep_gme_from/)

" HFs & short-sellers have been carefully coordinating FTDs to prevent GME from returning to the threshold security list. This is because even bona-fide market makers must deliver shares for threshold securities, and as long as GME is not on this list, bona-fide market makers can avoid closing out FTDs."

Looks like something is bleeding and "I won't be the on on the chopping block" is starting to come crashing down.
