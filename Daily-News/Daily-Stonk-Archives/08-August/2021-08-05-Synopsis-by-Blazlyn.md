Gooooooood Moooooorning Superstonk!

It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Pull your butt out of bed, do 3 sets of 5 pushups, look in that mirror and tell yourself that you love you because this ape does.

I have been educated and gained a wrinkle. Here is [Reverse Repo explained in a way even I can understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owwk1p/the_rrp_number_is_incredible_but_what_does_it/h7iv86i/?context=3). Now he is just standing there menacingly.

[On the other side of Schett's Creek you can see the remaining Treasury Budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oy105t/daily_treasury_balance_update_for_0803_507b_48b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Number go down and congress is out of session for 5 more weeks... Tick. Tock.

[Bank of America seems to have shorted GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxz8kg/bank_of_america_is_short_gme_and_is_positioned/)

A new and improved post outlining the actions of BoA. Kinda makes me wonder if they were the one that was supposed to pack the paddle on Shett's Creek.

Give this wonderful thing a perusal and fall down the rabbit hole in this post as [u/peruvian_bull](https://www.reddit.com/u/peruvian_bull/) walks us through how RRP's, MMFs, and the Shadow Banking System all seem to be connected in this saga. The Treasury and the Fed are creating massive collateral shortages in the shadow banking system which is driving Money Market Funds to use the Fed's RRP Facility in record numbers. The huge liquidity injections from the Fed are putting enormous weight on the system and sucking collateral out, so MMFs are using RRP to get the T-bill collateral back on their books. Risks to the primary dealers are rising. New collateral (Treasury bond) supply is all but cut off for the foreseeable future--all in the backdrop of raging inflation. Buckle Up.

[Looks like some super secret ETH work is going on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxm4vn/tens_of_millions_of_existing_users_i_myself_dont/)

Soooo there is a super secret project within an existing corporation.... Looking for all kinds of developers. This is something I will definitely keep you wonderful apes updated on. Who knows if it ties to the post the other day. Nothing is confirmed. Stay skeptical until we have something concrete.

I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor. All this is just some redneck's opinion who's brain is as reflective as a new Lambo's clear coat.
