It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Just a heads up Friday will have a very short post. Get up, do 5 pull pull ups (assisted is a okay), and grab a coffee it is time for a weekend recap!

[Treasury is at $321B](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p8cvs9/daily_treasury_balance_for_0819_321b_8b/)

Down, down, down it goes! Gently down the drain!

[Tick tock on the way to $0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p5potn/treasury_balance_prediction_new_linear_bankruptcy/)

This doesn't necessarily mean aÂ [real balance of $0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p5sv1z/correction_the_us_treasury_is_not_running_out_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share); it does act as a reliable indicator. Especially if it doesn't last to Q4.

Seriously. Do it.

[A Game As Old As Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p8rlj7/a_diamond_mining_company_from_over_a_decade_ago/)

Looks as if this game has been used for decades. A mining company had a similar (and by that it is nearly identical) event happen. Looks like they had damages paid out and the SEC was actually ahead of the ball here.

Looks like it spikes before each crash! Also take a look at that lil jump and dump in 2020. Doesn't that coincide with all the Tesla shorts? IIRC there was a lot of posts about this time last year on the birthplace of the apes about soy and everything being the way to catch up to a certain car stock....

Today's Puts

Give this a read. IT shows some pretty consistent behavior over the last 7 years. There are a lot of pretty pictures too for the illiterate apes. I only know enough to be able to type and post pictures.

[Pareto Distributions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p9mrqn/maths_intuition_the_pareto_distribution_why_i/)

Not just a fancy way to find what costs to cut! Seriously pretty much everything follows these curves. Give it a read and remember:

[Banks Are Not Playing With The PPP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p9k0b1/banks_are_opting_out_of_ppp_loan_forgiveness/)

Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and PNC have all decided to opt out of a new process for getting Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven directly by the Small Business Administration.

[Financial Hot Potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p73nx2/they_see_me_accountin_they_hating_a_look_into/)

Citadel sets it own terms for transactions between different broker dealer businesses they operate. They use reverse repurchase and repurchase agreement and use securities received to cover short position. Terms of those agreements between the affiliated parties might be of material difference. I haven't seen much attention given to this topic but the financial statements seem to point in that direction.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

Okay that is all for now smell ya later!
