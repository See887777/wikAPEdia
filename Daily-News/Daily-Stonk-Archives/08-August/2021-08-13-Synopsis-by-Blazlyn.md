It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

Wake up, bend over touch your toes and let one rip! It is time for Friday the 13th and I just got done petting my black cat!

[Reverse Repo remains above $1T](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p2hjao/daily_reverse_repo_update_0811_1000460b/)!

The system is now hit the cruising altitude of $1T and you are free to move about the Market. And by that I mean BUY and HODL.

In the event my goldfish brain forget here isÂ [Reverse Repo explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owwk1p/the_rrp_number_is_incredible_but_what_does_it/h7iv86i/?context=3)Â in a way even I can understand.

Looks like Repo Agreement spikes can actually be[good indicators of a market crash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p37kef/the_fed_just_published_36_years_of_its_money_data/)

[Treasury is at $389B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p37n2n/daily_treasury_balance_for_0811_389b_27b/)

Looks like a drop of $27B. This can only hold up for another11 days or so. Tick. TOCK.

Thank youÂ [u/edgar510](https://www.reddit.com/u/edgar510/)Â for charting it andÂ [u/canispeaktoyourmanagr](https://www.reddit.com/u/canispeaktoyourmanagr/)Â for the beautiful graphic.

[US Inflation Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p2cou7/us_inflation_chart_update/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

The last time that inflation has 3 consecutive months in the 5% range was June, July, and August of 2008. The crash then happened on September 29. Like all TA this is not an indicator of a crash but there is a strong correlation of the power of the dollar skyrocketing, weakening economic power, and a stock market crash.

[Housing prices jumped 20% or so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p30jqs/home_prices_in_the_us_soar_20_the_fastest_rate_on/)

Anyone else ready for the MOASS so prices drop and we can buy hoses for the same cost our parents bought the houses for in the 90s?

Some possible DD. Long story short it looks like a "T" and can signal a reversal.

We could be primed and ready for a jump!

No seriously. They are hiring users to post reviews and stories. That is all I have to say about that.

Thank you to the mod team!! Thank you to YOU ALL BEAUTIFUL APES!

Remember not to to give your password or log in information to anyone. If it seems suspicious don't do it! Phishing attacks have become more common across all platforms.

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries. This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. We help each other, we care for each other. Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

Okay that is all for now smell ya later!
