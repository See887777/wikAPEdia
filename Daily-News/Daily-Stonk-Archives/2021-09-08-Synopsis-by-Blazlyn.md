It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle! I thought yesterday would be my last post but it is my pleasure to introduce the new team that will be taking over.

Before I make those introductions I want to thank each and every one of you for your kind words and the outpouring of love. I received hundreds of kind words and multiple DMs of encouragement. These words scattered throughout the day helped me start to center. It will be a long walk but I know that I am not alone. Thank you all from from the bottom of my heart. As a community that is what sets us apart. That is why we will make a difference. I believe in you all.

I also believe in the team that has stepped up. They have someÂ [great](https://pixels.com/featured/whale-pod-corey-ford.html)Â [ideas](https://www.verywellhealth.com/ideas-for-decorating-your-cast-2549336)Â and I can't wait to see what they do with it! Without further ado they are:

[u/MadSmatter](https://www.reddit.com/u/MadSmatter/)

[u/Hipz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hipz/)

[u/Luma44](https://www.reddit.com/u/Luma44/)

A few others and I will remain behind the scenes helping to curate information and write up summaries.

Today's news is one thing and I am sure that the team will pull together something great for tomorrow.

[GameStop Quarterly Earnings Release Date!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pbj81a/gamestop_announces_second_quarter_fiscal_2021/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

GRAPEVINE, Texas, Aug. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Â GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), today announced that it will report second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the market closes on Wednesday, September 8, 2021. The Company will host an investor conference call at 5:00 pm ET on the same day to review the company's financial results. This call and any supplemental information can be accessed at GameStop Corp.'s investor relations home page atÂ [http://investor.GameStop.com/](http://investor.gamestop.com/). The phone number for the investor conference call is 877-451-6152 and the confirmation code is 13722703. The conference call will be archived for two months on GameStop's corporate website.

Good news? Time for a Dip?Â [Markets did dump...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pjttye/corrected/)Â Probably for liquidity. Get ready for a fire sale!

Keep in mind that this is a business meeting and conduct yourselves accordingly

If you're attending the event/going to Grapevine. This is a time to allow shills/others to stand out by acting a fool or making wild speculations. Go only off of what is stated. There maybe an announcement about any or none of the following Gmerica, NFT, Business Model Changes, etc. Ryan may speak and he may bot. Temper expectations. If something is stated as private and or internal DO NOT POST IT. I don't care that this community is about GME. This is a public forum. Private company news is just that. It will be made public in due time.
