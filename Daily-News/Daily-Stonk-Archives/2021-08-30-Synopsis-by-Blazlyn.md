It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!

I hope that everyone had a great weekend! It is time to grab some coffee, take a seat, and read the weekend highlights!

I hope that everyone stayed safe through Ida this weekend! Please remember to stay away from any downed power lines and avoid any water that you can not see through. Washouts/unstable land are not uncommon after a storm with a ton of rain. Stay safe, boil your water and good luck. We love you apes!

This isÂ [u/myplayprofile](https://www.reddit.com/u/myplayprofile/)Â he is laying out some serious data about options. How they tie to the actions in January to March. Take a lesson and gain some wrinkes about how they work. Anti-options sentiments were originally laid out by some people who were later debunked and made our forum slide.

NOTE: OPTIONS ARE A GAMBLE. YOU CAN AND WILL LOSE MONEY LEARNING TO DO THEM.

That being said there is a lot of good money in options. DFV did them. There is the other side of the fence that the financial barrier of buying a lot of options is in the 20k range for 100 now as opposed to what 2 shares of GME costs now. Buy and HOLD is a time tested strategy. Options are part of the rocket fuel. If you can play options it isn't a bad call just don't do only that. Hedge your bets.

I believe that NFTs are going the change the world in a very big way, with proper valuations for intellectual properties (ie. the Scarlett Johansson vs Disney fiasco), that will potentially encompass games, items in games, movies, E-Books, Music, Tv shows, podcasts, paintings, 3-D renders,Â *stocks,*Â and evenÂ *deeds.*Â This is absolutely something we should be excited for!
