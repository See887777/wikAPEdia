Today is September 9, 2021. The sun rises on another day of trading for our favorite stonk.

Q2 2021 Earnings were released yesterday.Â Sales were up 25%!

There are so many positive things going for our favorite stock. Fundamentals alone continue to shine; they cut operating losses by a whopping 50% AND opened a new fulfillment center covering the continental US coast-to-coast for the first time ever. Additional highlights from earnings are below.

Surprisingly, for the first time after an earnings call, hedge funds threw in the towel in the face of good news and let the stock run, run, run... yeah, no, of course they didn't. But most of us have been through earnings drops before. There's only one thing to do.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk - 9/9/2021](https://preview.redd.it/poqzantpvgm71.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92488d91212b2fc1036ce6266db7d02bef78b0dc)](https://preview.redd.it/poqzantpvgm71.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92488d91212b2fc1036ce6266db7d02bef78b0dc)

In case you missed it, here are the key takeaways from earnings:

For the more visual learners among us, let's compare 2021 to 2020. Looks like fundamentals remain solid even in graph form:

If this was your first earnings drop, welcome to the party. It was weak sauce. All it means is that there's an opportunity to buy the dip once more in case you're in the market to buy. To quote our very own DiamantenhÃ¤nde Ape:

"Of course, the Short Hedge Funds love to attack the price aggressively immediately following earnings releases, in an effort to sell a fictional narrative that investors have lost confidence in GameStop as a company and are selling." -Â [u/Parsnip](https://www.reddit.com/u/Parsnip/)

Let's not forget how far we've come: we're up 20% over the past 30 days! When in doubt, zoom out.

[u/3for100Specials](https://www.reddit.com/u/3for100Specials/)Â dropped some wrinkly DD -- "Glass Castle -- New Game +" which is definitely worth a read.

Reverse Repo is over $1T once again. This is showing no signs of slowing down.

Possible DD around "Dividends" appearing in Q2 earnings but not prior earnings reports? Dividend coming soon?

Speculate about this, if you will. Item 5 in the 10-Q suggests continued cooperation between Gamestop and the SEC.

Be excellent to each other and remember:Â Ape no fight Ape. No matter the stock in the basket, we are all in this together. If our interactions continue to be civil, then bad actors and shills stand out like sore opposable thumbs.

Thank you to the mod team!! Thank you to YOU ALL BEAUTIFUL APES!

Remember not to to give your password or log in information to anyone. If it seems suspicious don't do it! Phishing attacks have become more common across all platforms. As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries. This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. We help each other, we care for each other. Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes! Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.
