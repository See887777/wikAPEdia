It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle! I regret to inform you all that this will be my last post for The Daily Stonk.

I have had some things happen over the weekend where I am not in a good headspace to be able to keep curating as much information and try to pull it together for everyone. Mental health is an important thing and it is something that I will spend my moon money on bettering and advocating for. I will help whoever picks up the mantle however I can. If anyone would like to take it over please feel free to message me or respond to this post.

Earnings report tomorrow. DFV over the weekend. Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.

Until next time friends.
