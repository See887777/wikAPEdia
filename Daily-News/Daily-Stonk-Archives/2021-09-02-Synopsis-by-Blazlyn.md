> Price changes are usually supported by volume. If the stock is trading at 200, and some joker places a sell order of 2 shares at 100 and someone buys one, then the price of the stock is now 100. Obviously the price won't last at 100, there isn't enough volume at that price to sustain it. When there is a little volume going, it'll gap fill back to 200.
>
> So this kinda happens all the time in PM and AH. Not enough volume to make price changes sticky.
>
> In this case, the gap happened mid day, but the logic still applies.
