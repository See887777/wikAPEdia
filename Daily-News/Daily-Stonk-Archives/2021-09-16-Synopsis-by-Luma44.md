GOOOOOD Morning Superstonk!

It's Thursday, September 16, 2021.

Does anyone smell that? Smells like MOASS and ComputerShare servers overheating.

*insert flashy intro card*

This is your daily news.

Well, it's been all about ComputerShare today, but there's more development on Evergrande's nuclear meltdown, and other news worth tracking.

Let's get into it.

Apes have been transferring shares and buying en masse through ComputerShare. Great 101 level explanation from¬†[u/Future_Fauna](https://www.reddit.com/u/Future_Fauna/)¬†here:¬†[Direct Registering of shares through Computershare is our Ace in the hole for triggering MOASS ‚ÄºÔ∏è](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pow073/direct_registering_of_shares_through/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

The short, short version is that ComputerShare is the company that issues shares on behalf of Gamestop. "When you Direct register your shares with Computershare (by buying from them directly or transferring shares from another broker) you change the direct ownership of the stock from the DTCC to your actual name... This is uncharted territory but ultimately means either withdrawing all shares from the DTCC forcing shorts to close or directly through the DTCC forcing shorts to close. "

So, in summary:

EVERGRANDE continues what is likely to be a continued freefall into oblivion.

And, just like every other executive with advanced knowledge of impending failure or financial loss, the leaders are calmly watching their own money collapse with the utmost integrity. Like the violinists on the Titanic, going down stoically with the ship. /s

No, you guessed it, the executives appear to be pulling out their personal investments. Retail investors are the ones who will lose. Remember, behind this collapse, there are people hurting and losing everything. No dancing! Apes will get to help soon enough.

On a happier note, looks like GG is giving retail investors permission to 'smash' short sellers. Didn't know that we needed permission, but we got that going for us... which is nice.

Dave Lauer continues to advance the conversation around faster settlement - looks like there's progress being made.

Failure to deliver data has been released for the second half of August 2021. Bear in mind:¬†*The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails. Thus, it is important to note that the age of fails cannot be determined by looking at these numbers. In addition, the underlying source(s) of the fails-to-deliver shares is not necessarily the same as the underlying source(s) of the fails-to-deliver shares reported the day prior or the day after.*¬†(Source:¬†[SEC's page](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)¬†)

PSA - Let's talk about Stop Loss Orders for a second. It's worth the reminder.

Imagine, if you will, that you have a couple of moon tickets, worth, no less than $69,420,000* on average (*just a lowball number for the sake of argument). Now imagine knowing how much you would be willing to sell one of those moon tickets for. And nobody knows for sure what the peak price will be.

Ok, now imagine that you originally bought that ticket, for, say, $200. And you decide that you don't want to lose money while waiting for the voyage to begin. So you roll down your window, hang your head out of the rocket and scream to the heavens, "I don't want to lose my $200, so if the price drops below, say, $180, I'll sell it. That's what you're doing when you set a stop loss.

Anybody with level 3 reporting access, say, an evil company who desperately needs to buy up a whole crap ton of moon tickets, can see this stop loss in the system, and potentially manipulate the price down to $179.99. That means you will sell your moon ticket for $180, lose $20, disembark, and potentially miss the trip.

Don't do stop losses. There's no upside.

Here's a good reminder about¬†[LIMIT SELLING](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pov3w5/reminder_when_moass_occurs_use_limit_orders_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)¬†versus Market Selling, from¬†[u/Spugnacious](https://www.reddit.com/u/Spugnacious/). This is an important concept to keep firmly in mind. Make sure you do your research and understand this concept. If you hit market sell, it doesn't mean you get the price on the ticker. It means you get the price that the market dictates -- if there are buy orders for $200, you might just get that price. Limit selling means that your moon tickets will not sell below a price at which you want them to sell.

Know these concepts. Now's the time to make sure you understand.

Keep watching Apes. We're getting closer by the second.

Edit 1 -¬†[u/madsmatter](https://www.reddit.com/u/madsmatter/)¬†Audiocaster's note: "The S&P did finish green today, meaning the line of resistance in yesterday's post did not get broken. While triangles and exponential curves get broken all the time, I think it's important to keep a tally of the ones that do, and the ones that do not. Because a broken clock can still be right twice a day."
