*Bastille* Grey...👀

[July 14th, the date of the GME crypto coin launch date, is Bastille Day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nl2vld/july_14th_the_date_of_the_gme_crypto_coin_launch/)

> Learn more about this important date: <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day>

> That launch date is not accidental.

> What's more, Bastille is a synonym for citadel. Wonder who's going to be storming the Citadel this time...

So Bastille is a form of Citadel

Brick is also a digital currency term.
