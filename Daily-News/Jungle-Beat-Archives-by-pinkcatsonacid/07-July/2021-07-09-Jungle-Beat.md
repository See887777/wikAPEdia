thanks u/zedinstead

Well Superstonkers, between the apes on this sub and the people who saw RC's tweet yesterday about the Gamestop lego set, it appears it has received full support needed to make it to the next phase of development. Seems like the perfect keepsake to remember just how much we love the stock, and the store. I would most certainly buy 2 so I could keep one in the box forever, and repeatedly step on the other set around my mansion for years to come. 🙃

Hey Captain-Fan here, happy to see that his programming knowledge is finally useful to get in on the tweet explanation game.

A pull request is a coding thing, it means that you've added some code to a project and are asking the owner of that project to add it.

When multiple programmers are writing a program together, it is very important that they don't accidentally overwrite each other's changes. To prevent this each developer downloads a copy of the 'master' version of the code. This master version contains all the accepted changes to the code, so you are sure that it will work. The developer will then start writing new code, and submitting pull-requests. When receiving a pull request, the owner of the code will check if it does not cause issues, and accept the request if it doesn't. This new code is now part of the master version, so that the other programmers also download the new code the next time they download a copy of the master version

[One of the addresses associated with the GameStop NFT had a transaction today. Any wrinkle brains able to tell what it was used for?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogjbcy/one_of_the_addresses_associated_with_the_gamestop/)

Top comment from [u/nuclear-falcon](https://www.reddit.com/u/nuclear-falcon/):

Official Gamestop NFT Contract "GME NFT":

0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e

Was created by "Creator":

0x10b16eede03cf73cbf44e4bfffa3e6bff36f1fad

"Creator" is the account in question that OP linked.

*Creator is a contract itself!* If you go to the contract's [etherscan page](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10b16eede03cf73cbf44e4bfffa3e6bff36f1fad#readProxyContract) -> Contract -> "Read Contract as Proxy" you can get a little bit of information. The NAME field is "Gnosis Safe" which is a service in the form of a contract to force multiple people in a company to sign off on transactions before they happen, which is how you keep crypto at a company safe. [Here](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3876456-what-is-gnosis-safe) is a brief overview from their website.

If you go to the Creator address, you'll see a transaction from ~8 hours ago and then one that happened ~5 minutes ago (all from the time of writing). The "Events" tab on etherscan allows you to see which functions were executed.

Transaction from ~8 hours ago was to add "Add Owner" function execution. I think this means they added another person who can sign off on transactions.

Transaction from ~5 minutes ago executed 2 functions:

Remove Owner - to Remove a person/wallet from signing off on transactions

Add Owner - same as the one from ~8 hours ago that adds someone

What I think this means:

The NFTeam is adding new people who have rights to sign off on transactions with the official GameStop company crypto. This is a security measure that means no single person at the company can control/steal/send crypto to anyone else

Personal FUD: Defeating the Enemy Within

by [u/bradduck_flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/bradduck_flyntmoore/)

Howdy apes! [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) here! Today, I'd like to talk to you all about Personal FUD and how to overcome it. What IS personal FUD, you might ask? For the newer apes who might not know, FUD is an acronym meaning Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. It often comes in the form of shills using disinformation or misdirection, even straight up lies or threats. BUT, it is also all those negative thoughts creeping around in your head that whisper negativity to you.

"You didn't earn this." "It'll never work out, it never does." "You'll find a way to mess this up, just like everything else you touch." "Other people deserve this more than you." "Give up, it isn't worth it." "What about all the people that will suffer if you break the economy?" "You never get lucky, this is no different." Those are just a few examples of personal FUD. The things we say to ourselves that bring us down and make us question why we are even here in the first place.

I've seen a lot of apes go through this, especially when they first get deeply involved with GameStop. Hell, I went through it. It is for this reason I write to you today, to let you know: apes together strong; you ARE worthy; and you DO deserve happiness and tendies. I shall now elaborate.

Whose capital are you investing? Yours. Whose time are you dedicating to learning about the stock and the market as a whole? Yours. Who has to deal with the shills constantly trying to drag apes down and convince them they are wrong? It's YOU! It is all apes. Who has been patiently waiting for days, weeks, or months, only to watch the stock get manipulated like crazy? You again. But guess what? Apes are STILL winning, despite all the fuckery they can muster.

Nobody made you do any of that. It wasn't luck. It was all a conscious choice you made to better yourself, your life, and the lives of those you care about. Is it a risk? Sure, most worthwhile things are. There is no way to know what the future holds. This risk, unlike most others, however, is extremely calculated. There is a mind-boggling amount of info supporting a MOASS. Hedgies r fuk, as the saying goes. Just look at the media for confirmation. How long has this "been over" now? I don't know about the rest of you, but I ain't hear no bell!!

As a community, I've seen some incredible love and respect and knowledge and kindness and humor being passed around. Blows my mind every day. This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest place on the internet, and what apes are doing WILL change the world. It has already started. Just look at all the new rules that are being put into place because of the actions of apes! Look at the extremely knowledgeable, industry professional AMA guests that come here and the light that burns in their eyes upon seeing how serious apes are about breaking the corrupt game to pieces. It's amazing. They know it, I know it, apes should know it, too.

I'd like to leave this on a note for those who still have Personal FUD rattling in their heads, despite what I have said here. Reach out to your fellow apes. Engage in the community. Learn. Laugh. Don't be afraid to talk about your Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE. Some of us likely still are. Lean on the apes that have more experience or have been in the game longer. Apes Together Strong means helping each other become better than we are, every day. I do not Fear for our future, rather, I am excited for it. I am not Uncertain of the outcome, as we have already won; it's just a matter of waiting for reality to catch up. And I do not Doubt apes will change the world, as I can see it happening before my very eyes.

Power to the Player! 🚀🌙

Time Out! 🙅‍♀️

by Pink

As we approach another weekend, I want to first commend everyone here for doing such an amazing job of helping to keep the sub clean. As difficult as it seems sometimes, we are running like a well-oiled machine. Having said that, I would like to take a minute to discuss the reality here.

Whatever is happening in the broader market right now- [which seems to indicate a big correction coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogp3se/a_tldr_history_of_market_crashes/)- is going to happen regardless of what happens in this sub. We are a community of wonderful apes that all happen to share a love of the stock, and it's wonderful to be able to congregate here and discuss the future of the stock we like and company we love. This will seriously be a time we will always look back on fondly, no matter what the future holds.

But I stress again, that whatever is about to happen, is set to happen. If the stock goes up, if the market crashes, moon soon or not, millis or billis or trillis or whatever... it is going to happen no matter what we do. The power is not in our hands. All I do is buy a stock I like and HODL it tight. And I have all the time in the world for that, it doesn't cost me a dime more than the ask.

The hedgies must pay every day that they hold a short position. And not just the implied cost of holding the position. They have to pay the media for their spun narrative, and their shills to infiltrate and harass our community.

*Which brings me to another point. We don't harass anyone. Not hedgies, not other subs, and not former mods. So anything referencing that mod and their recent visit to our sub will be removed.*

So spend some time away whenever you can from the craziness that we are witnessing. Go outside, drink lots of water, spend time with the fam and friends... pet your dog and HODL your shares. We'll get there when we get there. ✌💖
