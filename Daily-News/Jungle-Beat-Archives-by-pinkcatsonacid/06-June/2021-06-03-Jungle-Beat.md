*My interpretation:* Sears represents the old way of retail, which he is destroying with his genius innovation. As the skull denotes, the old way of doing retail is under construction.

75+ years ago, our grandparents in the USA were ordering everything from their stove, their kitchen, their entire *HOME* from Sears, who was thought to be a retail game-changer almost a century ago. That was the face of innovation during the Cold War Era. I know, I grew up lusting after the 1950s technicolor Betty Crocker pink kitchens:

Safe and Sound with Team SATORI

*written by SATORI dev,* [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/)

Hey everyone! [u/Grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/Grungromp/) of Team Satori with a security suggestion for the day!

We've had a LOT of people reaching out with suggestions and things they've been noticing, and one comment from a cyber security pro in particular felt important to pass out to the sub.

We've been seeing small Reddit crashes and issues with access to the service and sub lately, and under normal circumstances they aren't anything to be incredibly concerned about. But we live in extraordinary circumstances, and caution is warranted.

Any one of these crashes could be due to any number of reasons, but there is always a chance data has leaked in some way. With that in mind, password rotation is a fantastic idea! There's no need to panic right now, but if Reddit starts behaving weird, rotate your security, just in case. Better safe than sorry!

Buy. Hold. Vote. Fight.

MODel Behaviour

Howdy apes! [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) here! How about that price action today, amirite?! Your Ape-bassador comes to you with a request from the Mod Team. Now that our beloved psychic monkey bot has been released into the jungle, things have obviously changed. It's obvious in new. It's obvious in hot. It's even obvious when you sort by controversial comments (one of my faves, btw ). HOWEVER, one of the things that still needs some attention is the number of posts of mass-shared content.

We all know the stuff. Take 27 DFV posts per tweet, of the same tweet, or link to the tweet, or the tweet of the link of the tweet, for example. Or when eToro allowed voting; goodness, I must have spammed 100 duplicates of essentially the same thing every hour for three hours straight. Ngl, it was NUTS lol. Don't get me wrong, I, too, have posted things that I JUST found out about, only to find out five minutes later that I, in fact, was late to the party. It do be like that sometimes. We are all apes, and apes are, by their very nature, thrilled to share good news and exciting new information with their fellows. That being said, please don't be too upset if a fellow ape says something about your post already being posted. It's not a competition to see who can get there first. Remember when reporting or letting an ape know their content has already been posted, to be excellent to each other. This is, after all, the way.

It is to this end that the Mod Team is making a formal request. Help us, help you. Weekend FUD patrol and The Knights of New are totally killing it, but the mass-shared content goes under-reported. It's a fact, and I think it has become easier to see, what with the SATORI hush that has fallen over this special little sub.

I'd also like to take a moment to say how impressed I am with some of the behaviour I've seen in comments lately. Shit-talking is being countered with patience, humor, logic, and kindness. Lies are being called out with a sense of calm confidence. Scare tactics and outright aggressiveness is being met with chill and zen and dismissiveness. It's enough to make an Ape-bassador cry. Truly.

sniffle Alright! So. Recap. Y'all are awesome. The love in here is really shining through, and Mods would REALLY appreciate if apes could start addressing the mass-shared content within the community. Report it. Let the OP know it's already been posted. SATORI can only do so much, and the content that flows on this sub is ultimately in our individual, collective hands. That's right, diamond fucking hands.

Power to the Player 🚀🌙

Vote- by u/[Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)

Again, and again, until the voting is over-- we will be back here reminding everyone of its importance. All of this DD, all of this guidance from experts, all of this attention on this naked short-selling issue... will be for nothing, if we don't vote our shares.We must vote our shares to show everyone how prolific this issue is. This isn't just a matter of corporate governance, this is about proving to everyone that our investment is being crushed by greedy naked short sellers dumping, potentially, millions and millions of "Phantom Shares" into the market. This isn't anything new, as all our AMA guests have said, this problem has been going on for decades in some form or fashion... But this time, the new variable is us.By participating in the vote you are ensuring that every last share that the shorts have fabricated and sold to us is counted. Once their actions see the light of day, in the form of the vote count, this will be the beginning of the end...There is no way out for them as long as we all vote our shares. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong or doesn't fully grasp the situation. And to those of you who are told by your brokers that you aren't able to vote... make noise, tell them you demand your rights... If you own shares in a company, it is YOUR RIGHT to vote on that companies decisions.

There is proof that this works, as we are receiving news that T212, [Etoro](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmtq9s/we_did_it/), [Tiger](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmt6lw/not_sure_if_posted_before_but_fyi_singaporean/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [FUTU](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmvme5/hong_kong_apesss_using_futu_can_finally_vote/) & more are now being made able to vote... So don't give up, if you had shares in time for the record date, then it is your right, do not take it lightly that they are trying to strip that from you.

🎉HYPE WEEK🎉

Monday- NYSE Closed for Memorial Day

Tuesday- DFV TWEETED- THE KING IS BACK!!!

Wednesday- [Lucy Komisar and Wes Christian AMA](https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk/featured) at 4:30 PM Eastern!

Thursday- [SEC Closed door Sunshine Act Meeting](https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-060321) at 3:15 PM Eastern

Friday- Take your protein pill and put your helmet on.

There is electricity in the air this week as many apes have pointed out! It is important that this hype train keep on rolling, and that the steady drumbeat, keeps on beating. As long as you know that there is always more to be hyped about on the horizon, disappointment cannot catch-up. So with that in mind, allow yourself to feel the hype, but remember that if it doesn't happen this week...We ain't going anywhere, it just means we get another week out in the jungle, screamin' with the apes. *OOK OOK*

Just remember, we got this far cause we do our research and we trust our findings. Armed with data there should be nothing that can kill the vibe. In the words of Dr. Burry:

*"I may have been early, but I am not wrong"* *(This quote has never rang more true)*
