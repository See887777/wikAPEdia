I am back again but have no fear, Pink will be back for the Friday edition of The Jungle Beat, tomorrow. Thanks for being so understanding!

Also, regarding today's price action, here are my thoughts:At this point, the price doesn't even matter to me. I have been on this rocket since February 1st, and since then I have seen them throw everything they can at the stock to suppress the stock and the sentiment surrounding it... The manipulation of this stock is so blatant at this point, it laughable. Some of you may have heard the saying about how a magician never does a trick for the same audience twice... Well, this is why.

We have had months to analyze price fluctuations in concert with other data points, tracking all these different indicators and how they react to certain events. We know how this game is played now and not even dipping back to double digits could stop me from buying more. If there is uncertainty brewing, all that one must-see is the fact that we went up for two straight weeks on no news at all-- Suddenly, we get a bunch of good news all at once, and the price drops by nearly 100 points... [OBV isn't budging](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwqrsw/nobody_is_fucking_selling_obv_remains_on_a/) and neither am I 💎🙌

I love this stock and I am going to wallpaper my house with GME shares if they make me wait long enough. This company is about to explode in popularity and I got nothing to lose by waiting.

Cheers,B_T

P.S. I totally bought the dippest of dips today, and it felt *amazing*

This had me in stitches 😂

Yesterday we got the news that Matt Furlong is the new CEO of GameStop and joining him as CFO is Mike Recupero. Both of these guys are ex-Amazon, both holding high ranks within that company for many years. So, for those keeping track, the ex-Amazon roster within GameStop's C-Suite is as follows:

-Matt Furlong Chief Executive Officer

-Mike Recupero Chief Financial Officer

-Jenna Owens Chief Operating Officer

-Elliott Wilke Chief Technology Officer

-Matt Francis Chief Growth Officer

(And that not even mentioning the amazing team being built below the executive suite. They have been building out a robust team for months.)

Now, I am not a huge fan of Amazon. They are completely destructive to any sort of competition which I believe is a healthy part of life. That having been said, Amazon is a hugely successful business that essentially prints money, and apparently even more so when there is an existential threat like the pandemic. So, I think that this team is going to do wonders with GameStop. I think under the guidance of Ryan Cohen and the addition of Chewy executives, GameStop can take on Amazon and others in the gaming industry... which honestly, shouldn't be too hard given how little attention its competitors actually pay to that side of their business. I am incredibly bullish on what comes next. LFG

*So much for GameStop going bankrupt* 😅***.... Sorry short-sellers, it's time to give up.***

😵Counting Confusion 😵

Yesterday there was a lot of FUD going around right as the vote numbers came out. Thankfully, you brilliant Apes squashed this in no time. For those that missed it, this was many people's reaction to seeing the documents:

*oH nO?! ThErE wAsNt OvErVoTiNg!!! SqUeEze OvEr.*

Turns out, it is even more clear now that there was overvoting.

When a company receives more votes than shares in existence, they cannot publish that number on their 8k and go about their business. This is something that got largely overlooked in our AMA with Wes Christian.

What happens is, the votes get "trimmed" to reflect a more possible number of votes, and the company gets informed of the real number. It is obvious that the number we were given does not reflect the vote, because if accurate that suggests that almost EVERY SINGLE SHARE was voted... and as much as we really wish that could have happened, we know that within our community there are many apes who couldn't vote.

That's not to say that the true number of shares out there is this number we were given + the ones that couldn't vote. What this really means is we have evidence that the vote was trimmed and likely by a lot. Unfortunately, the ball is still in GameStop's court with regards to the true number. Though I would expect to hear something about it from them soon, it is their fiduciary duty to their shareholders to deal with the situation, and we are all watching and waiting.

Edit 4:49 PM: Here is an informative DD on this matter from [u/greysweatseveryday](https://www.reddit.com/user/greysweatseveryday/)\

💰💲Earnings 💲💰

25% net sale increase across the board. Talk about Deep Fucking Value, this company is currently waaaaaay undervalued. Furthermore, they beat "Analyst" estimates by 50% earnings per share...

You can look further into the earnings report here: [GameStop Corp. Quarterly Report](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000066/)

*I am starting to doubt these analysts really know anything at all 💀 lol*

With all the documents that came out yesterday, all at once, there are still many wrinkle-brains that are combing through these pages. I think there are a lot more breadcrumbs to find within these fillings, but it will take time. This ape knows what's up:

🐵 Monkey Business 🐵

It sounds like everyone had a great time watching Monkey Business yesterday. We had a list of topics that were going to be discussed, but due to the large influx of new information that came out just as we were starting-- it went off track a bit...

All things considered, I think it went really well for our first episode. I am really looking forward to future editions of Monkey Business. Please let us know what you thought, we encourage constructive feedback! Also, if you are interested in participating in Monkey Business as a guest, or you have a topic in mind that you'd like to see discussed, please let us know!

🤖 Satori, Cyber Security, and you 🤖

We have been sending messages to approved users from [u/satori-blue-shell](https://www.reddit.com/u/satori-blue-shell/). We realized that this may cause an unintentional security risk. To remove confusion in the future, all messages will be sent directly via the subreddit. You can recognize an official message when the sender information contains "via [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/)." (see below) Any other message from an account claiming to represent Satori should be reported to the moderation team.

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat 06/10/2021 - 420k Edition](https://preview.redd.it/jdx20ia9og471.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde753082a2b7e3ef4f9fb530be8a51a8618e771)](https://preview.redd.it/jdx20ia9og471.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde753082a2b7e3ef4f9fb530be8a51a8618e771)

The Next Evolution in Seeking the Blessing of Satori

When we launched Satori just over ten years... wait... one week ago (time is meaningless right now apparently) we were confident that the tool we had developed could be very valuable to this community. We hoped Apes would be able to see the incredible potential this had to be a total game-changer, but we never imagined this level of positive response and immediate support. Thank you all for your trust and assistance.

Wanting to make sure we do right by the community, we've been hard at work to make sure Satori is the best tool we're capable of making. From the moment of reveal we've been having Apes inquiring how to get Approved status. We've had great success with our current system, and we're now announcing that we've made a significant upgrade! From the time of this post forward (like in the comments to this post, if you'd like) if you comment !apeprove!, you will send a message to Satori to enter you into a priority list to be approved. You will also then receive a message through the official method (as highlighted above) outlining the updated process.

We are so happy that we can now give frequent commenters and those right around karma limitations the ability to join the fold of the Approved as soon as possible!

A couple of quick points:

-   You only need to comment !apeprove! once to be added to the queue. Spamming the command will not speed up your process, and can result in your removal from the Approval queue completely. Shills spam. Don't do it.

-   If you are already an Approved User, then you do not need to do anything more! Keep enjoying the omniscient benevolence of our robot overlord!

-   We are now also moving to prioritize Apes who are below- or just above current karma requirements. We want to be able to contribute without the fear of being downvoted into silence.

-   REMEMBER: Approval is not an endorsement. It does not mean anything beyond the fact that an account has yet to act in a suspicious way YET. Do not let your guard down at any point.

-   🦧🧠💎👐🚀🦍🌝

-   EDIT: Anyone commenting will be seen by Satori. Even if you don't have sufficient karma to comment, it will get flagged in our system before removal by automod. So EVERYONE CAN GET IN.

Now, with that out of the way, a few pieces of housekeeping

*Defending the Sub: How to Report Nefarious Activity*

We have received a TON of help in many forms in keeping the sub clean. This has come in people sharing screenshots of shill posts, sending messages to the Satori team members, contacting mods, etc. Thank you so much for that! Remember, *We. Are. Satori.* Our Mind Reading Monkey is only as effective as the community itself. Please continue to be vigilant, use those down/upvote buttons, and if you see something, report something.

A word of caution: Just because you may think a post feels negative, or you disagree with it's premise or claims, doesn't automatically qualify it as FUD. Be aware of amplifying the echo chamber. And absolutely do not threaten those making the posts. We've got ways to deal with this properly.

We'd now want to give you specific guidance to allow you to be the most effective with your defense of this sub.

The absolute best way to draw the All-Seeing Mind of Satori to specific posts or users is to use the "message the mods" function of the sub. This sends a message to the entire mod team, which means there's a greater chance someone will see it sooner than if you message an individual. Satori will then be fed the information given in the message, meaning you reach both parties with one click. It's a one-stop shop to get the report to every single party who needs to see it, and also keeps the sub clear of posts of screenshots of FUD.

*A Return to Old Tactics: Bad Actors doing Bad Things*

The last week has proven to us that we're under the skin of those trying to bring the sub down. What we're doing is working. With heavy restrictions in place for posting and commenting, we're seeing a move back to older strategies, as well as a few new ones. There's been a surge in private messages, in downvoting folks below karma limits, reports of suicidal tendencies, and many other strategies to try and unnerve our community. Please be on the lookout, keep your heads on swivels, and if something looks or feels suspicious, report it to the mod team and Reddit.

Satori co-creator and [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) moderator [u/catto_del_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/) did a much more in-depth breakdown of what we're seeing, and what you can do to counter it, in yesterday's Jungle Beat, which is linked at the bottom of this post

Superstonk continues to grow

I was taken aback when today we hit 420k members on [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/). I remember the day of the migration here so vividly. I have never and will never see anything like that again. To see how much the ape community has grown since [r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/) is mind-boggling. I have so many more wrinkles on my brain and I could not have done that without the tireless effort of every single one of you apes. So a huge shoutout to everyone out there.
