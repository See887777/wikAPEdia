A Word from [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) about how Superstonk is POPPIN'

When I woke up today, I saw the most beautiful sight I thought I would ever see... 100k apes online! I saw this number and my jaw dropped. but then...

11:00 am - 123k

11:45 am - 130k

1:00 pm - 131k

2:27 pm -135k

2:31 pm - 147k

3:00 pm -149k

3:17 pm - 152k

4:20 pm - 173,000!!! ( ͡°( ͡° ͜ʖ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°) ͡°)

So yeah, 100k was just the beginning. Today [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) has reached a pretty exciting point. Not only did we continue breaking record highs with regards to our users online, but the retention of those users was outrageous. To put into perspective the kind of numbers we are dealing with, check out this post

[u/flyingsaxophone](https://www.reddit.com/u/flyingsaxophone/) [Posted about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm9a0n/120k_apes_online_right_now_the_worlds_largest/)

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat- Thursday 05-27-2021- AMAs FOR DAYS! 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/uigaslibup171.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9298583de4c7d1a2a01b27c6b1bfda929c0616)](https://preview.redd.it/uigaslibup171.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9298583de4c7d1a2a01b27c6b1bfda929c0616)

This is Modi Stadium in India. Its a cricket stadium and it truly is the largest sports stadium in the world. Holding a maximum of 132,000 people. When he posted this we hadn't broken past 120k but as of writing this, we would have more than sold out that stadium with our 149k online (OMG)... and that isnt even to mention the WHOLE OTHER HALF OF US NOT ONLINE.

If there was ever a doubt that we can make change, there isn't any longer. To those of you who feel yourself doubting that apes together are strong... look at that stadium... thats only half of us.

OOK OOK motherFUDers

Personal FUD: Defeating the Enemy Within

Howdy apes! [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) here! Today, I'd like to talk to you all about Personal FUD and how to overcome it. What IS personal FUD, you might ask? For the newer apes who might not know, FUD is an acronym meaning Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. It often comes in the form of shills using disinformation or misdirection, even straight up lies or threats. BUT, it is also all those negative thoughts creeping around in your head that whisper negativity to you.

"You didn't earn this." "It'll never work out, it never does." "You'll find a way to mess this up, just like everything else you touch." "Other people deserve this more than you." "Give up, it isn't worth it." "What about all the people that will suffer if you break the economy?" "You never get lucky, this is no different." Those are just a few examples of personal FUD. The things we say to ourselves that bring us down and make us question why we are even here in the first place.

I've seen a lot of apes go through this, especially when they first get deeply involved with GameStop. Hell, I went through it. It is for this reason I write to you today, to let you know: apes together strong; you ARE worthy; and you DO deserve happiness and tendies. I shall now elaborate.

Whose capital are you investing? Yours. Whose time are you dedicating to learning about the stock and the market as a whole? Yours. Who has to deal with the shills constantly trying to drag apes down and convince them they are wrong? It's YOU! It is all apes. Who has been patiently waiting for days, weeks, or months, only to watch the stock get manipulated like crazy? You again. But guess what? Apes are STILL winning, despite all the fuckery they can muster.

Nobody made you do any of that. It wasn't luck. It was all a conscious choice you made to better yourself, your life, and the lives of those you care about. Is it a risk? Sure, most worthwhile things are. There is no way to know what the future holds. This risk, unlike most others, however, is extremely calculated. There is a mind-boggling amount of info supporting a MOASS. Hedgies r fuk, as the saying goes. Just look at the media for confirmation. How long has this "been over" now? I don't know about the rest of you, but I ain't hear no bell!!

As a community, I've seen some incredible love and respect and knowledge and kindness and humor being passed around. Blows my mind every day. This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest place on the internet, and what apes are doing WILL change the world. It has already started. Just look at all the new rules that are being put into place because of the actions of apes! Look at the extremely knowledgeable, industry professional AMA guests that come here and the light that burns in their eyes upon seeing how serious apes are about breaking the corrupt game to pieces. It's amazing. They know it, I know it, apes should know it, too.

I'd like to leave this on a note for those who still have Personal FUD rattling in their heads, despite what I have said here. Reach out to your fellow apes. Engage in the community. Learn. Laugh. Don't be afraid to talk about your Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE. Some of us likely still are. Lean on the apes that have more experience or have been in the game longer. Apes Together Strong means helping each other become better than we are, every day. I do not Fear for our future, rather, I am excited for it. I am not Uncertain of the outcome, as we have already won; it's just a matter of waiting for reality to catch up. And I do not Doubt apes will change the world, as I can see it happening before my very eyes.

Power to the Player! 🚀🌙

[This masterpiece DD on Voting tells you all you need to know to vote your shares!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlpz4h/your_votes_are_important_the_time_to_vote_is_now/) HUGE SHOUTOUT TO [u/nauaf](https://www.reddit.com/u/nauaf/)**, our fellow mod, for putting in the time and effort to get this information into 1 document!**

Voting is not only how we expose [the illegal activity that has been plaguing our financial markets for almost a century](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nke7sp/post_ama_dd_lucy_komisar_ama_powerpoint_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as Lucy Komisar pointed out..

But it's also ACTIONABLE PROOF OF DAMAGES IN A US COURT OF LAW, as proven by our guest Wes Christian.

That means if we know a good lawyer, a lawsuit can be arranged, once we have proof of damages ;)

(smooth brains- proof of damages = proof of overvoting)

So this is it. This is the final room with the chest that has the boss key. The bokoblins are guarding it. We just leveled up and got the Master Sword with [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)'s DD drop. Here we go, apes. It's show time.

A note from your friendly local Pink Cat 🐈🦄✨

On yesterday's Jungle Beat, as many of you may have seen, I was just sitting there chilling in the comments, giving people flairs and trying to get back in the groove of things. Reddit was being wonky at the time, so I thought it was just me at first, but I realized that

THE ENTIRE TEXT BODY OF THE POST DISAPPEARED.

Now, the post *didn't* get deleted or removed. It was somehow *edited* down to only the header and intro part of the post. After sitting in shock for about 5 minutes and getting [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)'s eyes on it, we confirmed it disappeared out of thin air. I ultimately deleted the post because it was an empty shell siting there.

Idk, I wasn't logged into [u/TheJungleBeat](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheJungleBeat/) at the time, I was logged in and interacting with you guys as Pink Cats. So it couldn't have been an accidental edit on my end.

Long story short, if you experienced this yesterday with the reddit glitches, I would LOVE to put the mystery to rest. I was pretty heartbroken to find all that work disappear with no trace. (Literally. Our awesome mod [u/catto_del_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/) looked everywhere on the back end for it. Poof. Gone.) I don't know what happened to it. Even the draft for it is gone. Reddit admin has only offered the solution of changing the password and taking precautionary steps against a hack.

And after internal discussion with *every* other possibility, it looks like that's probably the only answer...

So, I appreciate your patience as we have figured out the growing pains of the Daily sub piece and what it will be called, when it will be posted, who will be posting it... etc. This piece will now be posted again by yours truly, because we had to take precautionary measures with the [u/TheJungleBeat](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheJungleBeat/) account, SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE OFFICIAL POSTS BY THIS ACCOUNT! We decided that third party accounts are a bit too vulnerable obviously, for the serious level of online attacks we are dealing with.

It's been a rough week.

Y'all have been so accepting, loving, supportive, and just altogether magical. I would literally do anything for this community. From the bottom of my heart, thanks so much for feeling like this pink cat's home. ✌💖🦄

|Harambe's Birthday

Friday - Harambe Memorial Day (R.I.P.)

There is electricity in the air this week as many apes have pointed out! It is important that this hype train keep on rolling, and that the steady drumbeat, keeps on beating. As long as you know that there is always more to be hyped about on the horizon, disappointment cannot catch-up. So with that in mind, allow yourself to feel the hype, but remember that if it doesn't happen this week...

We ain't going anywhere, it just means we get another week out in the jungle, screamin' with the apes. *OOK OOK* Just remember, we got this far cause we do our research and we trust our findings. Armed with data there should be nothing that can kill the vibe. In the words of Dr. Burry:

*"I may have been early, but I am not wrong"* *(This quote has never rang more true)*
