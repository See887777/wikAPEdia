Lucy Komisar AMA Part 2- Topic of Discussion- The SEC

*by* [u/Pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pinkcatsonacid/) 🐈🦄

[Here's a link to the Lucy Komisar Part 2 AMA from yesterday!](https://youtu.be/wuPizlDY0Ys)

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat- Tuesday 05-25-2021 🦍🤝💪](https://preview.redd.it/oxrxvtiyqb171.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb086c533add256b1da00eec59eaf6034b4de9a)](https://preview.redd.it/oxrxvtiyqb171.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb086c533add256b1da00eec59eaf6034b4de9a)

Yesterday after battling some pretty frustrating technical difficulties, we got to hear the most legendary bedtime story from journalism icon, Lucy Komisar. The topic of discussion was the SEC, and I think we all got a LOT more than we bargained for when she started getting into how Naked Short Selling has been going on for nearly a century.

[I made a Post-AMA DD here, which includes Lucy's script from the AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nke7sp/post_ama_dd_lucy_komisar_ama_powerpoint_and/)

There were some key takeaway points from Lucy's side. Here are the things she believes the SEC needs to address in order to fix the cancer that is Naked Short Selling (NSS)

*from the Lucy K script:*

What should the SEC do now? Solutions are there if it wants to protect investors, not do as it is told by the big broker-dealers.

-   Require buy-ins. Require the broker of the investor who doesn't get shorted stock delivered to buy it on the market and charge the seller's broker. Of course, requiring buy-ins would make the stock go up, the shorters lose money.

-   Restore the uptick rule so shorters can't sell for less that the last shorted trade. That would stop shorters hammering a stock down to bankruptcy.

-   Create a consolidated audit trail (CAT) to collect order and trade execution information to identify and enable punishment of illegal trading activities, including naked short selling. More than a decade after the SEC promised it, following the 2010 flash crash, CAT doesn't exist.

-   Impose real penalties on transgressors, like loss of license.

-   Send cases of serial trading cheats to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.

-   End the revolving door with Wall Street.

-   What will Gary Gensler do? And will he listen most to the pushback from the big brokers or investors like people on Superstonk?

So, if we want to create change within the system that was created to protect these crooks, we have to MAKE NOISE!

As many of you know, I myself have submitted tips and complaints to the SEC as well as other alphabet entities that were relevant to my tip like the Federal Trade Commission.

I am not suggesting 320,000 apes contact the SEC and just scream loud noises at them. I, myself, however will be sending a well versed letter with the proof I have of market manipulation, as well as the key points for change that Lucy listed above.

*Again, this is to be used discriminately by individuals wishing to file legitimate complaints!*

Mic check, Chairman G can you hear us? Cuz you're about to!

I want to thank all you apes again for your patience yesterday, and for being supportive to Lucy and hearing her message in spite of the issues! This is such a supportive community and I am so dang proud to call myself one of you. 💖💪

I heard y'all like hype trains....🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂

Lucy will be coming back to interview Wes Christian in an exclusive AMA style interview!

VOTE YOUR SHARES

Voting your shares is the Number 1 way to prove the magnitude of naked short selling. Here's info on how to vote your shares. Be sure to do so by the annual meeting date of June 9, 2021!

Steps to Voting:

1.  HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER

Obtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.

2\. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).

Do not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.

3\. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.

Take a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.

4\. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.

5\. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.

Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.

_________________________________________________________________________________

🐈 BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! 🦧

Well, did you...

-   Check your broker inbox for proxy info✔

-   Check your email✔

-   Send a message via your broker help/chat interface✔

-   Call your broker and request your control number✔

-   Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search✔

-   Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info✔

And what if I can't vote because my broker won't let me?

[Well, here's what this ape did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkoo7n/i_finally_made_it_voted/)

[And here's what this ape did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nknop1/after_weeks_of_mail_exchanges_with_our_broker/)

MORAL OF THE STORY: DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat- Tuesday 05-25-2021 🦍🤝💪](https://preview.redd.it/owllxrr6rb171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a147d9fa627280e81d8487be6df0b20fa05c52)](https://preview.redd.it/owllxrr6rb171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a147d9fa627280e81d8487be6df0b20fa05c52)

Don't forget to get your voted flair!

If you voted, type !apevote!

If you tried and your broker won't let you, MAKE A TON OF NOISE! AND DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!

But also type !novote! for your own special flair!

Dark Pools and Lit Exchanges

Lucy has mentioned it, Dave Lauer has talked and taught on the subject, even Wes Christian calls for an end to dark pool. Trading outside of lit exchanges allows for less rules and regulations to be applied, as Lucy and Dave have explained in depth. THIS IS HOW THEY'RE GETTING AROUND THE SEC! Is it the only way? OF COURSE IT ISN'T! But this is another action step apes can take to finally pierce the veil the shrouds these criminals in secrecy and protection.

Everyone needs to be routing their purchases of Gamestop shares through lit exchanges like IEX.

[Here's a post with great information on how to find out whether your broker offers these options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ni2gbm/why_are_memes_and_stupid_shit_still_so_popular/)

This will be a recurring section in the Jungle Beat, and we will be adding more information on how to do this through various brokers as we develop this story.

Something we have far too little of, in my opinion, are posts that help us review the basics of this trade. Its important to remember that we have new apes coming here every day to figure out whats up with GME.

[u/AaronJamesArq](https://www.reddit.com/u/AaronJamesArq/) is working on this awesome series, "Explain with Crayons" that puts the basics in an easily digestible format. This is not an easy task given the complexity of the matters at hand. I would highly recommend checking these out, and sharing them around:

-[Reminders for baby apes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/njxty1/reminders_for_all_the_baby_apes_visual_format/)

[-What Is Naked Shorting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nk40b6/explain_w_crayons_series_what_is_naked_shorting/)

-[Fudamentals of $GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkouqs/explain_w_crayons_series_fundamentals_of_gme_why/)

This is the kind of content that helps others get their foot in the door with regards to the GME saga. So we thank you for putting your time and effort into these, Aaron. So very excited to see more! *(Also as a dabbler in graphic-design, I must say I love your style!)*

There is electricity in the air this week as many apes have pointed out! It is important that this hype train keep on rolling, and that the steady drumbeat, keeps on beating. As long as you know that there is always more to be hyped about on the horizon, disappointment cannot catch-up. So with that in mind, allow yourself to feel the hype, but remember that if it doesn't happen this week...

We ain't going anywhere, it just means we get another week out in the jungle, screamin' with the apes.

*OOK OOK*

Just remember, we got this far cause we do our research and we trust our findings. Armed with data there should be nothing that can kill the vibe. In the words of Dr. Burry:
