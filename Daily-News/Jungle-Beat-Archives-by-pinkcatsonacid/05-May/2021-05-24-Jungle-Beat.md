Hi Apes,

B_T here! I am pleased to be addressing you guys again. Welcome to The Jungle Beat, a new collaborative project Pink and I are working on. We thought it would be great to bring you guys two daily posts:

The Daily Stonk having a greater focus on hard news, and DD. Something to start the day with, like a newspaper. While The Jungle Beat focuses on highlighting the community in a lighthearted, more casual way. Something that you can wind down with at market close everyday. Big news, community announcements, content from the Apes, like a community board. We hope you guys like it!

Today PinkCats is busy prepping with Lucy Komisar, but she wanted to welcome you guys herself so that said... Over to you [u/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsOnAcid/):

*What's up Superstonk!  I'm so excited to be working on The Jungle Beat with* [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) *and the whole mod team! This concept is ever evolving, and was born from the idea of providing a daily post written by apes, for apes. A speak-piece for the sub that brings you the latest, most relevant news from around Superstonk.* 

*Speaking personally, I sincerely enjoyed the time I spent with you all writing the Superstonk Daily and I hope that this new format serves to continue the idea that we are committed to growing this sub and it's following, using verified, trusted information from mods and community members alike! The Jungle Beat is the steady drum by which we all march in this Battle of the HODLers of GME vs. Goliath. Thank you apes for bringing the magic to this jungle! None of this would exist without this community and its resolve.* 💖🦄✨🦍💎🐈

📰 LUCY KOMISAR AMA TODAY 📰

We had a fantastic time hearing what Lucy had to say about us and about the issue of naked short selling, offshoring, the SEC, and GameStop. Today's AMA is going to focus on The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Needless to say this is going to be a hugely important insight on this matter given Lucy's history and familiarity with the SEC.

Lucy will be sharing with us the history, the purpose of the formation of the SEC, and sharing details on their regulatory oversight.

Tune in today at 4:30 pm Eastern on the [Superstonk Live YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPizlDY0Ys)

___________________

Suggested reading for today is Lucy Komisar's latest article on this whole short-selling scam:

♠♣♥♦ [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/)'s House Of Cards ♠♥♦♣

So as if the hype train wasn't rolling with enough steam already, [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/) brought us an appetizer for the HOC II&III with this little update:

*"I have officially finished the HOC part II and submitted it to Dr. T, Wes Christian and Dave Lauer (* [u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/) *) for review. They are welcome to share among their peers, as well.*

*I have shared this document with the MOD team and asked them to keep it hush-hush until we receive feedback. They can give their impression, but not any detail. That being said, it is a 24 page word document explaining how big the House of Cards truly is. Instead of trimming out vital information, I have decided to double-drop parts II & III at the same time once I have feedback from the experts.*

*I appreciate everyone being patient and ask for you to give our experts the time they need to fully review the findings. This is important and I appreciate all of their efforts to make the story airtight."* - [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/)

(This is legit how I felt - B_T)

I can confirm that this piece is going to make you mad and make you HODL and probably make you want to completely smash the broken way of doing things and start over (as if you don't already). We highly recommend taking this opportunity to refresh yourself on [HOC Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/)

Major shoutout to [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/) for such dedication to writing his entire collection of DD for all of us smooth brain apes to finally understand the elements at play here. We don't do hero worship around here, but we do give credit where it's due and Ato has been working tirelessly on the research and writing of this HOC trilogy.

Atobitt, you embody a true ape. This community appreciates the time you spend on your contributions.

📢 NEW MODS - In case you missed it 📢

[u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/) announced on the weekend that we have some new team members. This weekend went very smoothly and that was due, in no small part, to these two individuals... So glad to you have you guys on board. I am so excited for all the amazing ideas these guys have, there is some exciting stuff coming!

So, we thought this would be a great opportunity for them to officially introduce themselves. If you haven't already, say hello to [u/Sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sharkbaitlol/) and [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) !

"*Greetings, apes!*

*It is I,* [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/)*! BT and Pink asked me to write a blurb about my new role as mod for the best subreddit in existence, so here me be.*

*I was brought on to function as an Ape-bassador, if you will, with a focus on community engagement. Your friendly neighborhood Ape Assistant. That means interacting with all of you breathtaking creatures!* *I'll be in the comments with y'all, cracking jokes and pretending I have wrinkles, same as I was before becoming a mod, in addition to a few pet projects I have in the works. Some of you have already encountered the "wild FLAIR POST"s out in the jungle (please, if you got new custom flair from me in the last 24hrs, comment "thanks for the flair" below! Some of them were hilarious and others were very creative), but don't worry if you missed it. I promise there will be more. In fact, let's start now! Comment the custom flair you want and I'll do as many as I can before my fingers fall off. One of my main goals, after all, is to get every ape that wants it their own flair. I'll also be developing a "suggestion box" that apes can provide feedback to as far as things they like/don't like about the sub, ways we can improve, content that y'all'd like to see, etc.*

*Lastly, in an effort to make sure the other mods are able to dedicate the time they need to their own duties, I ask that you tag me in posts requiring attention (beyond the normal reporting of spam/inappropriate material/FUD/etc). If I am unable to assist you myself, I'll call upon whichever mod is most appropriate to the situation. I'm not saying to only tag me, but that I am happy to serve as liaison between apes and mods. Fun fact, most mods are tagged between 30 and 200 times a day. Every day (I believe red, for example, is at 400+ notifications as I type this). As you can imagine, it can get difficult to keep up, especially when there are other projects that require focus and attention to detail, plus boring IRL stuffs.*

*Thank you all for everything you do for this sub. It wouldn't be the best place on the interwebs without you. Y'all know the mantra by now: Buy, Hold, vote if you can, and always be excellent to each other!*

*Power to the Player! 🚀🌛 "*

*Hey everyone,*

*It's your ape,* [u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/) *chomping away at the DD posts. It's been a crazy couple of days since being brought on, I greatly appreciate all the kind words all of you have been leaving me. This post may serve as a good time to bring up why I was brought on, and what I aim to do during my time here!*

*It's becoming apparent that* [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) *is becoming a key destination for many (including reporters) to find information about not only on GME, but the economy. The level of data we have apes including into their posts is often worthy of Pulitzer awards; that's not an exaggeration. These are posts loaded with links, graphs, math and data. Believe me, they're getting noticed on a global level.*

*To help initiative further, my goal here will be to categorize, summarize and provide additional research points on news articles and DD around the sub. You will probably see this initiative around superstonk in the comments section of a post, under the header "Shark Tank Review". This is an effort to help simplify the information being presented into a quick "TA;DR (too ape; didn't read)" that helps you understand what part of the puzzle you're looking at!*

*Here is an example of one of these posts 🙂*[*https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nj7n6m/cnbc_to_citadel_what_or_who_is_the_link/gz6nm3b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nj7n6m/cnbc_to_citadel_what_or_who_is_the_link/gz6nm3b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

*With that being said; I too am only one ape, so I will rely on this community to tag me on posts you feel could be important to the puzzle. I will try my best to get to as many posts as I can!*

*To the moon and beyond apes 🚀🌛*

🗳VOTE VOTE VOTE🗳

I will say this over and over again until we get to the Shareholders Meeting:

EVERYONE MUST VOTE THEIR SHARES. If you are given the opportunity to vote and you pass it up, you are doing yourself a disservice. You aren't taking the opportunity to exercise your right as a shareholder, and therefore you are allowing the HF's to get away with this behavior.

It sounds like every day more and more apes get their paperwork to vote. I don't know about you guys but I am totally HYPED to see the vote count. I have a feeling it is already far beyond the number of shares that exist... but only GameStop knows that number for now.

**Psst* Hey Ryan Cohen, feel free to hit me up with that vote count! I can keep a secret* 😏

🎉HYPE WEEK🎉

Mon - Lucy Komisar AMA | T+35

Tues - T +21

Wednesday - Heads of big banks in front of congress Part 1 [(Info)](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/congress-quiz-wall-street-bank-chief-executives-next-month-statement-2021-04-15/) [(Watch)](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407635)

Thursday - Heads of big banks in front of congress Part 2 [(Info)](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/congress-quiz-wall-street-bank-chief-executives-next-month-statement-2021-04-15/) [(Watch)](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407635) |Harambe's Birthday

Friday - Harambe Memorial Day (R.I.P.)

There is electricity in the air this week as many apes have pointed out! It is important that this hype train keep on rolling, and that the steady drumbeat, keeps on beating. As long as you know that there is always more to be hyped about on the horizon, disappointment cannot catch-up. So with that in mind, allow yourself to feel the hype, but remember that if it doesn't happen this week...

We ain't going anywhere, it just means we get another week out in the jungle, screamin' with the apes.

*OOK OOK*

Just remember, we got this far cause we do our research and we trust our findings. Armed with data there should be nothing that can kill the vibe. In the words of Dr. Burry:

*"I may have been early, but I am not wrong"* *(This quote has never rang more true)*
