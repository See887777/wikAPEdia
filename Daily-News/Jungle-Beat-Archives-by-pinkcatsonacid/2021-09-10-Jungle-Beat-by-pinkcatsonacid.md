🎮🛑GameStop News from this Week 📰

Quarterly Earnings Report

Short 'n sweet. Matt Furlong delivered the news in less than 7 minutes. [You can listen to it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnjBnO_rs_E)

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat Week of 09-10-2021- Important Computershare updates, Quarterly Earnings, and more!](https://preview.redd.it/2go8n54uvpm71.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd549e19473f824dd1add828459b9a9eb2d5f85b)](https://preview.redd.it/2go8n54uvpm71.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd549e19473f824dd1add828459b9a9eb2d5f85b)

u/sebet_123 is the memelord behind this one!

He ended the call saying, "In terms of our outlook, we're not providing formal guidance at this time." which is pretty unsurprising given their track record of not saying much. Ryan Cohen even mentioned it in the shareholder meeting- they know everyone wants to know their gameplan but they're not going to divulge their hand just yet (paraphrasing, obviously) And especially given the SEC investigation that they've been cooperating with for months (more on that below 👇) it's not surprising that we have a tight-lipped Board of Directors right now (that notably also skimmed over mentioning the blockchain-experienced team).

It's all bullish to me.

🎮 SECOND QUARTER OVERVIEW 🛑

-   Generated net sales of $1.183 billion, compared to $942 million in the prior year's second quarter.

-   Ended the period with cash and restricted cash of $1.78 billion.

-   Ended the period with no long-term debt, other than a $47.5 million low-interest loan associated with the French government's pandemic response.

-   Invested in long-term growth initiatives that include expanding the Company's product catalog, enhancing its fulfillment network capabilities and technology, and adding talent across the organization.

-   Entered into a lease of a new 530,000 square foot fulfillment center in Reno, Nevada, positioning the Company's fulfillment network to span both coasts of the continental U.S.

-   Entered into a lease of a new customer care center in Pembroke Pines, Florida and started building out U.S.-based customer care operations.

And then [apes figured out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb7dcv/i_think_its_all_just_too_coincidental_first_the/) that this tweet was from a Gamestop in Arlington, VA, located just minutes away from SEC HQ (in fact the closest Gamestop to SEC HQ!)

On Wednesday Gamestop [released Form 10-q](https://investor.gamestop.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001326380-21-000090) with some juicy info that seems relevant to those tweets (and the timeframe...)

Cool. So the SEC has been investigating the company for around 4 months, at least. And yet the price continues to be manipulated to this day.🔥 Nothing to see here folks 🔥

Computershare Update- No more paper certificates at this time

Computershare Part 3 has been posted twice and now and twice I've deleted it. Once on purpose and again today by accident when trying to edit some new info in. I've since updated the part 2 post because recent developments have made the part 3 pretty useless anyway (it was mainly about how to get a paper certificate.)

Paper Certificates are no longer available, per Gamestop, as of September 9

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat Week of 09-10-2021- Important Computershare updates, Quarterly Earnings, and more!](https://preview.redd.it/8zekoocbqpm71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae285046f1c4f9fc90b3ca7f3ca60ec907d6aa98)](https://preview.redd.it/8zekoocbqpm71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae285046f1c4f9fc90b3ca7f3ca60ec907d6aa98)

big sad

I'm so sorry to those whose hopes were raised when they saw that I got a paper certificate! I don't know why they've stopped- I've heard today that it was actually a paper supply issue, as in they are actually out of the pre-printed certificates, and that they're also switching to a Quick Cert system- both of those pieces of info coming from a CS rep, but they have been historically ill-informed about anything above level-1 support (like when they told me today's shares sell for tomorrow's price...) so take this with a grain of salt. They are sending me a company prospectus so I can dig a little further.

Nobody knows exactly how it works, apparently. The answers from CS reps are as varied as the apes who call and ask the questions. They're obviously not prepared/equipped for the influx of detailed questions they've gotten.

🦧 Thinking Cap On... Where does the Company get the DirectStock purchased shares they sell?

Now, I've been trying to understand the chain of command for the transactions with Computershare because agents have been telling me that only *book* shares are withdrawn from the DTC. So I've been harping about the different kind of accounts within computershare and stressing that only book entry shares are withdrawn from the DTC, which is what I want for my infinity pool.

But let's think about this..(I seriously can't get an answer for this I spent an hour on the phone with a supervisor today and multiple live chats and they just aren't getting/understanding my question..) Shoutout to [u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/) who once again has pushed me to gain a few new wrinkles!

Ok.. If the DTC is the clearing house for the broker, then it makes sense that the shares transferred in from a broker are shown as DTC Withdrawal, which they do. But with the DirectStock program, you are purchasing shares directly from the Company, so my question is, where does the company get them from? Are they issuing from the existing float? If the company is directly issuing shares through computershare, doesn't that eliminate the need for a middleman like the DTC altogether?

Following this line of thinking... it's possible that it doesn't matter the Computershare account type when it comes to fuking the hedgies (DTC) once and for all.

That would mean it doesn't matter the account type or whether you transfer in or buy through Computershare... it's all real shares that the DTC can't touch- *this is unverified since I can't get a straight answer from Computershare*.

I'm waiting to hear back from GME corporate, still. But I want to get to the bottom of this.

In the meantime, while we figure out the anatomy of the Computershare transaction.. even though there are a lot of different answers floating around from different CS reps... Direct registration is definitely the way.

Computershare is the fuse to light 🔥💣💥

WARNING:CONFIRMATION BIAS AHEAD- EXTREME TITTY JACKING PROBABLE

Direct Registration is a proven way to expose phantom shares that result from abusive naked short selling.

Computershare is the only way to take your shares away from DTC circulation for good. Remember when we were campaigning constantly for weeks and weeks to get the word out to every shareholder to vote? (Which was totally within the legal rights of us, the shareholders btw.) We made a few Euro brokers literally *change their game* just by tweeting at them enough. I want to do that again with computershare. *Imagine if apes registered the entire float* ♾⛲

International Apes- Yes you can do it too!

Here are the countries listed as being served on the Computershare website

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat Week of 09-10-2021- Important Computershare updates, Quarterly Earnings, and more!](https://preview.redd.it/ysakirwd8qm71.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ebcab4ded1cf53550faedb4ce908bc1d0266125)](https://preview.redd.it/ysakirwd8qm71.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ebcab4ded1cf53550faedb4ce908bc1d0266125)

There is a reported workaround using the "[Give a Share](https://www.giveashare.com/)" program, although it's pretty expensive at $375, it's a valid option!

The IBKR Workaround

*With a disclaimer that IBKR sucks and* [so does Leon Cooperman](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs)

[Apparently there's a workaround for international apes using IBKR](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9mc38/all_international_apes_can_register_their_shares/) shoutout to [u/n01u](https://www.reddit.com/u/n01u/)! This seems to be the most legit way for anyone in any of the countries listed above to actually succeed in direct registering their shares. You can either transfer your shares to them, and then transfer them to Computershare, or buy directly thru IBKR and then transfer those to CS. Both methods have been done successfully by apes from several of the countries listed.

.. But BEWARE OF IBKR!! I'm still salty about them removing the buy button back in January and an ape never forgets so just proceed with caution on that one. 🤷‍♀️ I certainly don't endorse anyone using IBKR as their regular broker- they're the rich man's Robinhood. But this is legit as far as I can tell for apes around the world to be able to participate in direct registration!

How to transfer shares to Computershare

This section to be edited with more info and resources as needed

-   Don't forget to check out my previous posts in this series for more detail on my process. [Here's Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p42cuv/computershare_megathread_drs_direct_registration/) and [here's Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pficfa/computershare_megathread_part_2_withdrawing_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!

-   [u/MommaP123](https://www.reddit.com/u/MommaP123/), [u/Big-Bedroom8783](https://www.reddit.com/u/Big-Bedroom8783/) and many others have written extremely helpful guides on this topic and recorded their journey!

-   [u/da_squirrel_monkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/da_squirrel_monkey/) wrote [this fantastic step-by-step guide from transferring your shares from most major brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p9ap23/guide_stepbystep_drs_transfer_to_computershare/). Some of them, however, can be done with just a phone call or chat!

-   1-800-544-6666 is Fidelity's number to DRS with Computer Share. Big thanks to [u/overlypositive](https://www.reddit.com/u/overlypositive/) for sharing that direct line! It took them a matter of minutes to get it done!

-   TD Ameritrade customers can open a Chat with Ted and do it through there, or call them 1-800-669-3900. I did my process through TDA but filled out a form and scanned it in. Apparently it gets easier than that!

-   Still trying to figure out if the difference between the two account types- plan and book- even matters as far as fuking the hedgies. All I know for sure is Computershare is the way.

Don't forget to change your flair once you've registered!

✅ I Direct Registered 🍦💩🪑

There's a limited edition flair for Computershare! You can set it yourself as it's a premade option in the flair list, but tag me here in the comments and I can assign it to you if you're having trouble!

This is the ultimate pressure on SHF.

This is how to expose phantom shares resulting from their abusive naked short selling.

This is how to prove definitively that retail owns the float.

This is how to show the DTC they are no longer trustworthy to handle securities.

This is Power to the Players. ✊
