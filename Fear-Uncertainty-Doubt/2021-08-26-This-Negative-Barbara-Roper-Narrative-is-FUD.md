Alright, I saw a post at the top of our sub out with god damn pitch forks because of the SEC's newest senior advisor, Barbara Roper.

I went over to her Twitter and holy shit, bad actors and shills are all over with really negative comments.

The number of posts quoting her in Feb are sus. I totally agree that if those were really her words, that's bullshit. But we've been shit on for months by everyone. The MSM, financial fuckers, you name it. Why does this matter now?

Anyways, I did some digging and found some DD on her.

Wall Street doesn't like Barbara Roper. This is why they're using her quote back in Feb to paint apes as a pitch fork mob mentality.

I do wanna bring her testimony to attention about the 2008 crisis to outweigh the negative narrative people are posting about.

Also, I keep getting downvoted and shit on by people. It's jacking my tits hard that they don't like this.

"What we and other banks, rating agencies and regulators failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending and too much leverage in the system -- that credit had become too cheap.‚Äñ2 What comes through from these statements, however, is that Wall Street, while accepting some responsibility, views its role as at best secondary. They were simply market makers, according to this account, bringing together buyers and sellers, and providing liquidity to the markets -- doing --God's work,‚Äñ if you will.

The evidence, however, suggests a much deeper culpability. Wall Street's blame is not simply that they failed to recognize risk building up in the system, or failed to adequately sound the alarm when they did recognize that risk, or failed to warn their customers against doing things that were harmful to those customers' interests. Wall Street's blame is that, in their pursuit of the profits that fed their multi-billion-dollar bonus pools, they abandoned any sense of responsibility to ensure that the products they developed and sold served some economic utility or served their clients' interests or benefited anything but their own bottom line.

This reality was on full display in last week's hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. As the Subcommittee noted in its release in advance of the hearing, --Goldman and other investment banks played a crucial role in building and running the conveyor belt that fed toxic mortgages and mortgage-backed securities into the financial system.‚Äñ Documents released by the Subcommittee call into question Goldman's efforts to portray itself simply as a market maker serving client needs.
