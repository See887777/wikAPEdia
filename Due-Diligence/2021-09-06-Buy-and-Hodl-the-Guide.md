Greetings Apes!

I'm not sure very many of you need this DD as I assume everyone at this point knows the thesis and has done their research. All of you have proven your mettle and diamond hands for months.

I feel as someone that contributes in my own small way to this community that I should express my feelings toward some rumblings I have been hearing...

As many of you have become aware there are cycles that effect the price of GME as more and more data becomes available to us with the passage of time, we are beginning to realize these.

Retail should not attempt to trade these cycles for two reasons

1.  Selling shares reduces the potential effect of each run

2.  While we have some evidence of these cycles we have zero knowledge of their reliability. Many times throughout this we have been surprised by SHFs ability to manipulate breakouts and expected movement.

But with the idea of swaps and other derivatives operating on cycles greed can take hold as long term profits become ignored in order to profit off short-term movement.

This is not the way.

MOASS only works because apes buy and hold

We may not do a lot to effect price discovery in the short term honestly retails cash injections are not really noticeable on short time frames.

But the effects of the strategy employed¬†separately¬†by hundreds of thousands of apes is what forces MMs and SHFs alike into terrible positions week after week. Every share bought and held regardless of cost basis is another cut added to the thousands that will eventually bleed them dry.

I know some of these cycles seem obvious but¬†the underlying causes are not yet fully understood. However, greed is a strong motivator, and a definitive cycle encourages trading regardless of ideologies.

Remember that shares of GME represent a piece of a company that is carrying a short interest of 200+% and are part of a float that has over 300+% ownership. These shares carry potential energy unlike any stock that has traded before it, to trade these shares openly on the markets presents the short hedge funds a way out of what is currently an inescapable position.

Since technical analysis is my thing let me show you in the best way's I can prove the buy & hold strategy is effective and guarantees MOASS.

The Foundation

Retails buy and holding present a difficult challenge to the SHFs and MMs alike by creating an almost impenetrable wall that they can't break though. That's right exponential floor guy was right...but maybe a little rigid in his analysis of what this meant.

[![r/Superstonk - Buy and Hodl: The Guide](https://preview.redd.it/mbe21obojxl71.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=0723dac584f19a06c71e96c63dc5e23231a0978a)](https://preview.redd.it/mbe21obojxl71.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=0723dac584f19a06c71e96c63dc5e23231a0978a)

An example of exponentially increasing price with every cycle

This also gives a very good example of when the last time apes released shares into the market. Ever since the flash crash in march there has been little to no selling by retail.

This theory is very simple¬†selling shares reduces the potential growth of each cycle.

Another visible effect of holding is that it reduces the amount of downward pressure that can be applied to the stock. So even though billions of dollars have been spent each time to drive the price down the lowest possible price keeps getting higher.

[![r/Superstonk - Buy and Hodl: The Guide](https://preview.redd.it/twy38f0rrxl71.png?width=2460&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1abebeb953b1be78e70c8daa1400956ed51502)](https://preview.redd.it/twy38f0rrxl71.png?width=2460&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1abebeb953b1be78e70c8daa1400956ed51502)

Consistently Higher Lows

Illiquidity

Another effect of buy and hold is that over time the stock becomes very illiquid. The short hedge funds continue to pump synthetic shares into GME's float and apes continue to buy them. Not only effectively reducing the number of tradeable shares but also forcing short hedge funds to create more synthetics in order to cover previous FTDs.

These compounding losses worsen over time as long as the floor (shown above) continues to rise the constant losses on the short positions compound exponentially.

Additionally the constant hammering of the bid in order to suppress day-to-day price action increases the spread between bid/ask.

Meaning, when SHFs finally have to cover their cycle of price suppression that covering raises the price much much faster. Making the next cycle even more difficult to suppress.

Fucked Hedge Funds on the 1D timescale

A Little proof the shorts haven't covered

Something new and old apes alike ask and probably the best theory to come out of that cesspool of paper hands over at meltdown.

How do we know they didn't cover in January?

Well maybe this helps explain it.

Options

I have not, nor will I ever encourage apes to participate in options on GME, unless they understand the risk involved. However, this is the only solution that I see that could possible satiate the inevitable greed of attempting to trade these cycles without sacrificing the floor apes have so diligently built. Nobody was ever hurt by a little education.

So I think it's best to cover the advantages and disadvantages, best use case for GME, and some additional material. So apes can begin to educate themselves on this financial derivative.

As always I consider better informed apes stronger apes.

Why not options?

Well for most people, especially inexperienced traders, the risk of options far outweighs the rewards. Losing money on these contracts essentially shovels hard earned money into the hands of Market Makers. Lack of understanding of options ultimately will lose people that do not understand them money.

Why Options?

Options present a contractual ownership in the underlying. They are a leveraged position meaning they represent control of 100 shares of the underlying per contract. As retail this can be beneficial as you can leverage a much larger number of shares than you can afford to buy at market with less capital exposure.

Best use case:

Options Yolo's of old are ineffective on GME. While we know the stock will go up it has been traditionally very difficult to predict exactly when. This is the primary reason so many apes have lost so much money on GME options and essentially why their use is frowned upon.

The best use case for calls on GameStop are near or¬†[in the money calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp)¬†with far out¬†[expirations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp)¬†(at least quarterly or greater).

These give plenty of time for the price to move favorably, If the price moves against you you will suffer less in losses than you would if you owned the underlying.

The most valuable part of a GME contract is without a doubt...

*theta-*¬†The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the time decay of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturity, as long as everything is held constant. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day.

The primary reason "cheaper" contracts are so affordable is that they have very little theta left and expire in a short time period. These options are cheaper because the risk present to the seller of the contract is lower.

Meaning it is¬†more likely to lose you money.

Educational Sources for learning more:

I highly suggest that anybody interested in options reads through these articles at a¬†minimum¬†and downloads a¬†paper-trading platform¬†with options like TDA's Think or Swim and practice options trading before ever considering using real capital on these risky investment vehicles.

Conclusion

While the short interest on GameStop basically guarantees a squeeze the parties involved in shorting it have Trillions in assets. They can and will do everything in their considerable power to drive the price down on GME and maneuver themselves into a position that is more equitable.

Buy & Hold prevents this buy constantly increasing the losses they sustain on their short positions they are left in a spot where they cannot get out from under them.

This is a siege not a battle, and they are starving.

One final note:

Ronald Wayne was one of the original founders of Apple, twelve days later, he sold his 10% share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for¬†US$800, and one year later accepted a final¬†US$1,500¬†to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly incorporated Apple, totaling¬†US$2,300.

That stake would have been worth $264B as of market close Friday...

Don't be a fucking Ronald...
