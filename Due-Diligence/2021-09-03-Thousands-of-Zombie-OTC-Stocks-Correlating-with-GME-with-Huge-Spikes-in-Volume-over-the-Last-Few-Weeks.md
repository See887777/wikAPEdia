Look under your chair!!! YOU GET A MOASS! AND YOU GET A MOASS!!

Wanna take a guess as to what the above image is?

The volume of 1700+ OTC non retail tradeable stockies. Graphed alongside each other from Jan 2021 to Sep 2 2021.

There are 13k stocks that are doing funky OTC shit but I narrowed it down to about 1700 of Citadel's closest friends.

What do you notice about this graph? Right off the bat? (Literally no pun intended, I noticed it after I typed it lmao)

Oh you say you notice some giant spikes at the end there, huh?

That's the beginning/middle of August 2021.

I'll upload the list and analyze with more data in an another post soon but I've been staring at these for 15 hours straight and I just wanted to get this fact out there and go to bed.

It's not just Blockbuster, Sears, ToysRus, etc. It's like thousands of stocks in secret.

Here's some examples of the various types I've found.

I figure there's at least 3 separate strategies going on with these.

1.  Zombie

No activity for like ever and then out of the blue the last week BAM!

MNVN rise from your grave!

STRANGE SPIKEYS ON GME BOOM CYCLES! HMMM

3\. "Pump starting Jan 27 and then emergency dump when shit starts really hitting the fan."

It's a mixed bag. They all correlate with GME in some way and most of them look like 1 of those 3 charts. They follow mostly the same pattern with volume ramping up to never before seen levels in the last few weeks.

The same pattern that umm.. MSM tells us is retail "propping up meme stocks".

Well the issue here is most of these are marked as defunct, delisted, "Pink No Information", "Can't contact the company" type stocks. Retail can't buy most of them so how the hell is this happening?

It's pretty obvious it's not retail.

This one's interesting. It starts pumping in January and then February spikes. And now all of a sudden it's reaching highs just the last few days. FOR NO REASON.

Another thing, a large percentage of these stocks have spikes from Feb 4th to Feb 8th. Idk why that's significant but it seems too clustered to be a coincidence.

Probably to keep shorting GME down to 38.

Funny thing about ParkVidya. Their website is unreachable.

[http://www.parkvida.com](http://www.parkvida.com/)

Yahoo lists them as

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRKV/profile?p=PRKV>

Sector(s):¬†Financial Services

Industry:¬†Shell Companies

Full Time Employees:¬†3

Yahoo says they're formerly known as Montana Mining Corp. and changed its name to ParkVida Group, Inc. in September 2011

Here's their Twitter for the resort:

<https://twitter.com/parkvida>

Nothing since 2011.

And the SEC says they were incorporated in Nevada...

<https://sec.report/CIK/0001104672?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_0lqrIstcUAzoWSwzQaBBTBExd.NNVzNio9ooOVr8IzU-1630666664-0-gqNtZGzNAiWjcnBszQkl>

And their last filing was in 2015. Which by the way was a notice of termination / deregistering of the stock.

<https://sec.report/Document/0001211524-15-000011/>

According to:

<https://www.ipohub.org/delisting-and-deregistering-guidance/>

Once a company has successfully¬†deregistered, the company's stock can no longer be publicly traded. When a company deregisters, it is also delisted simultaneously because it can no longer be publicly traded

The company is SHUT DOWN. NO BUSINESS. STOCK CAN NOT BE TRADED.

But yet it's still kickin'.. AND RECENTLY.

Just ONE of the many scooby doo mysteries you'll find when diving into this list.

Again, I'm going to compile a much larger DD later with a few other wrinkle brains help for everyone to dive in on it if they so chose.

But for now I just wanted to share that it's way bigger than Blockbuster and Sears.

This one's interesting, it's up 216% the past month and just drops almost 50% in the last 5 days.

Clearly it's a number 3 with fries and a coke.

There's so much data I have to pile through and look at. The next post will be way more detailed. I know it's morning but I pulled an all dayer and nighter and falling asleep as I type this so I'll say Goodnight!

I look forward to what mysteries ya'll uncover with this insight.

Edit: there is an alarming amount of comments saying they bought Sears as if the point of this post was to make them do that. Saying stuff like ok you convinced me üòÇ bruh this post has nothing to do with Sears stop.

Edit 2: Fixed an issue in the post that made the pictures go away after my first edit on mobile lol

Edit 3: Just to give you a scale of how MASSIVE this shit is, here's a zoomed in look at the first chart.

First the chart:

[![r/Superstonk - ZOMBIES - Found thousands of OTC stocks correlating with GME with huge spikes in volume starting mostly in the last few weeks. Many of them rising from the dead within the last few days. $0 to $0.001 real quick.](https://preview.redd.it/g3245ro7vel71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b422e87399616c81defad9048c6a0a6a810abb)](https://preview.redd.it/g3245ro7vel71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b422e87399616c81defad9048c6a0a6a810abb)

And zoomed in:

Many of them rising from the dead within the last few days. $0 to $0.001 real quick.](https://preview.redd.it/prxbe707wel71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=8590a107c268f821867271d8e8f779eb1eef33cf)](https://preview.redd.it/prxbe707wel71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=8590a107c268f821867271d8e8f779eb1eef33cf)

Looks like a rainbow colored forest. But because there are so many stocks in the graph, it looks like a jumbled mess zoomed in. I just wanted to give this pic for scale.

Edit 4:

Further proof of this fuckery for ppl asking how this is correlated to GME:

BABL had a 278% surge at 11:20 AM today.

BABL

At the same time GME had a short ladder attack.

GME

SRSR = up 5% today while GME down 5%

MNVN = up 80% today.

This shit is real.

Edit 5:

After I posted this, I got the anonymous message from RedditCareSources for suicidal posts lmao I'm not suicidal. Not one bit.

And also, they deleted the repository where I was getting this OTC data from.

Funny thing though they can delete the repository but they can't delete the stock tickers I already downloaded all of them lmao

Edit 6 lmao...

So after I posted this, the repository went down. Then a couple hours after I posted the edit, the repository went back up. SO idk if that is correlated or just the server was down for a bit. But it's back up now.
