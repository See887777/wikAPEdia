*Edit #4: Owner of stockanalysis responded! In the original question there was nothing about GME but they still filled in the blanks! - I'm going to call ahead and call this bullish.*

First things first. FACTS.

GameStop Shares Outstanding with data, dates and¬†sources.

There are multiple declarations made by the company to the SEC and by Matt Furlong. I've gone through all of them and I'm fast forwarding to September 1, 2021.

GameStop 10-Q shows 76.49m shares outstanding as of September 1, 2021.¬†[Here's the link.](https://news.gamestop.com/node/19256/html)¬†It's on the top, right under the GameStop logo.

This is the most recent data. We're taking this number into account.

Yahoo Finance also shows this data. So we know that Yahoo Finance shares outstanding data is correct for sure. This is a fact.

IT FUCKING CHANGED AS I WAS WRITING THIS DD

That's right! I began writing this DD when the declared float was 248.48m. I went to get a screenshot for this DD and it fucking changed. Now it's 249.51m.

*A glitch that continues to glitch and somehow not unglitched for almost 2 days? Nah.*

Also others have determined the funkiness using the Balance Sheet data on Yahoo Finance. Let's do some basic smooth brain arithmetic to confirm.

Let's play with some numbers!

$1,720,000,000 / $5.64 = 304,964,539 shares

304,964,539 x 0.8218 (minus insiders) = 250,619,858 FLOAT

Today's number was 248.48m (1.03% difference from 250m number above)...

...until it changed to 249.51m less than an hour ago... (0.50% difference from the 250m number above)

Rounding errors. I'll allow it.

All the bears and the doubters would say "It's a glitch!" so another source was needed.

It is 4:24 PM EST September 11, 2021 and this is the data from stockanalysis.com

124.61 million float. This is same as the number we saw from Yahoo Finance yesterday.¬†[Here's the wayback link.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210910124841/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)

Let's dig in.

Now this is where I get stuck because I don't have a subscription to the Nasdaq. If anyone here does and wants to share the data that would be amazing.

This is the data Stockanalysis (and probably also Yahoo Finance) is using.

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?

This is the crux of the issue. The only thing that matters. How many shares are REALLY out there?How many shares do these motherfuckers have to buy back? This is the question they¬†*can't*¬†let us know the answer of. This is their Achilles heel, the fucking hole in their Death Star.

By the way, something else to think about. If there are actually more than 250m shares of GME out there (of course there is - at least a billion imho) what does that make GameStop's valuation? 45 billion dollars. What do you think about¬†*this*¬†valuation Mr. Chukumba? Considering how much they shorted it, it's still cheap.

FUD PATROL : TINFOIL SOUP

Yes, take everything with a grain of salt. Check everything. These people are masters of shitfuckery. I¬†*am*¬†fucking paranoid. Just do your own DD and make your own independent decisions. This¬†*might*¬†be them using a 400IQ giga-brain strat and giving us a number so we think the squeeze is over after this many shares have been bought. This is possible. For me personally, that doesn't change anything. I will keep checking all the data and learning everything I possibly can.

TL;DR

It's not a glitch. It's a calculation made using real data on a database and it's changing because the underlying data is changing. This data is being used by more than one source. If anyone can find more sources, please share. This might be new regulation forcing an accurate count of shorts.

The idea that someone fat-fingered a number that results in this is ludicrous. The idea that this is a glitch and has not been fixed for almost 2 days now it's preposterous.

Have a wonderful day/evening/night, wherever you are in the world. You are a part of history. I raise my glass to you, fellow GME holder!
