Everyone say hello to the FBI -

[He is also now holding an xxx amount of shares because he is required to read every DD](https://preview.redd.it/ma5nb60u2ak71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d37b5d493883893a4d30122403acda9be108cee)

Look, I'm not making shit about fuck on a opinion if GG or the SEC/CFTC or any other individual working within those agencies is currently complicit. I'm not saying that they aren't either. We should be pointing out their past associations but I don't think we should be making conclusions either. For sure, they are fucking weird... but that is the industry. We don't have fuck about shit for any actual evidence on specific individuals colluding - yet. So stay hopeful but don't close your eyes and bring up everything you find. I also do find it weird that the SEC has increased how many press releases on individual whistler blower tips and the awards they've claimed for doing so all of a sudden. Obviously, if you find fraud, significant fraud, you should be compensated. But the SEC won't get mad at you for telling other Government agencies... and plus we shouldn't concentrate our Deep DD findings to a single organization - Maybe the SEC staff your tip was submitted to was hungover as fuck when they opened yours and marked it as "retarded" and moved on. IDK? Either way - the FBI (personally I think the coolest of all the agencies... them fuckin rain coats are sick) will listen!!! This is probably the first time in history we have so many retards analyzing anything and everything.

EDIT:¬†was about to go to bed until I got two comment notifications on my phone for this post at LITERALLY THE SAME EXACT TIME saying almost the same fucking thing. Did I hit a nerve with the shills? I didn't research their profiles but damn... that's some coincidence eh?

TLDR 1: If you have submitted any whistler blower complaints to either the SEC or CFTC, you can also submit the same one - via the FBI's tip website. Please remember, the tip website is not a compliant website. Tips should be concise, articulated and accompanied by relevant documents with thoughtful conclusions. Please do not flood the FBI with "wen lambo". You are also under consequence of purgery when submitting a tip - so remain truthful.

Look at what this guy on another sub did a few months ago.

and of course, you remember¬†[u/MentlegenRich](https://www.reddit.com/user/MentlegenRich/), the guy who went to a friendly gathering of couples and knew one of the¬†~~wife's boyfriends~~¬†husbands¬†was in the FBI?¬†He ended his post with:

"He told me that he could give me his contact information and I could share the information with him. He said that he understood a bit of what I had to say only cause he isn't big on finances or the market,¬†but he knows people who do, and that by sending him the info rather than submitting it via the FBI site, eyes will get to it faster than waiting in line, having HQ route it, etc.¬†*Additionally, he said that since he works in Chicago, the team he works with will be right there to access information on Citadel since that's where they work!"*

Honestly, if you haven't seen this post - it is worth a read.

Ok lets move on to exactly those people within the FBI that are big on finances and the market...

| DETAILS ON THE FBI'S INVOLVMENT IN FINANCIAL CRIMES |

I found a report on the FBI from 2008 which includes a lot of statements and actual events from the 2008 financial crisis. I took out the most relevant and interesting parts for you that are interested.

[Source: A Report From The FBI On Financial Crimes In 2008](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2008)

*The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigates matters relating to fraud, theft, or embezzlement occurring within or*¬†*against the national and international financial community.*¬†*These crimes are characterized by*¬†*deceit, concealment, or violation of trust**, and are not dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or violence. Such acts are committed by individuals and*¬†*organizations to obtain personal or business advantage.*¬†*The FBI focuses its financial crimes investigations on such criminal activities as*¬†*corporate fraud, securities*¬†*and commodities fraud, health care fraud,*¬†*financial institution fraud**, mortgage fraud, insurance fraud, mass marketing fraud, and*¬†*money laundering.*¬†*These are the identified priority crime problem areas of the*¬†*Financial Crimes Section (FCS) of the FBI.*

Corporate Fraud Stats:

-   *Through FY 2008, cases pursued by the FBI resulted in 158 indictments and 132 convictions of corporate criminals. Numerous cases are pending plea agreements and trials. During FY 2008, the FBI secured $8.1 billion in restitution orders and $199 million in fines from corporate criminals. The chart below reflects corporate fraud pending cases from FY 2004 through FY 2008 as follows: FY 2004---332 cases; FY 2005---423; FY 2006---486; FY 2007---529; and FY 2008---545 cases.*

Securities and Commodities Fraud Stats:

-   *As of the end of FY 2008, the FBI was investigating 1,210 cases of securities and commodities fraud and had already recorded 357 indictments and 296 convictions. Additional notable accomplishments in FY 2008 include: $3.1 billion in restitution orders; $43.6 million in recoveries; $151.4 million in fines and $84.2 million in seizures. The chart below reflects securities and commodities fraud pending cases from FY 2004 through FY 2008 as follows: FY 2004---987cases; FY 2005---1,139 cases; FY 2006---1,165 cases; FY 2007---1,217 cases and FY 2008---1,210 cases. As of the end of FY 2008, as many as 150 special agents assigned to addressing these crimes.*

Lmao, yo Gherk look - this document mentions our boy from Credit Suisse lmayooooo

Significant Case Highlight¬†Credit Suisse (New York City):

-   *Credit Suisse is a global financial services company, advising clients across the globe in all aspects of finance. ST Microelectronics (STM) is a Switzerland based semiconductor company with annual net revenue of US $9.85 billion in 2006. In 2006, STM invested $400 million with Credit Suisse in what was purportedly securities backed by student loans (to include investment statements); however, the funds were backed with sub prime loans. Credit Suisse tried unsuccessfully to settle the matter for $280 million. The two managers, Eric Butler and*¬†*Julian Tzolov**, have been indicted on securities fraud charges and were arrested in June 2008.*

*Now more than ever, the well-being of the global economy rests on the diligent enforcement of laws and regulations designed to ensure the fair and orderly operation of the capital markets.*¬†*The FBI is not only cognizant of this critical requirement, but is uniquely positioned to help meet the U.S. government's criminal investigative responsibilities in this area.*

*The FBI has also seen the following emerging schemes associated with the downturn of the financial markets during 2008: builder-bailout, short-sale, and foreclosure rescue scams. A real estate*¬†*short sale*¬†*is a type of pre-foreclosure sale in which*¬†*the lender agrees to sell a property for less than the mortgage owed.*¬†*In the current rapidly declining U.S. housing market,*¬†*short sales are becoming more and more frequent*¬†*as banks are faced with taking on more and more homes through the official foreclosure process.*¬†*A short sale fraud scheme is where the perpetrator uses a straw buyer to purchase and ultimately default on a home loan, creating a short sale situation so that the perpetrator himself can take advantage and purchase the home at a steep discount.*

*The FBI works closely with various governmental and private entities to investigate and prevent fraudulent activity in the securities markets. In an effort to help bolster these relationships and optimize workforce needs, many FBI field offices operate task forces and working groups with other law enforcement and regulatory agencies. These agencies include the*¬†*SEC, U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAO), Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).*

This is probably the first time in history we have so many retards analyzing anything and everything. The report above mentions that they only had 150 special agents during 2008. WELL SuperStonk has thousands of specially retarded agents! Lets help them out if we can. And please, just to mention - please only submit a tip if you have serious evidence or diligence that you've done. No need to flood the tip line with "The Theory of Everything" over and over. FBI APE already seen that probably.

OK - SO. Maybe we should......

Here are the tip/contact links to each, except for the SEC and the CFTC since we already know about them. Also the post office... they deal with enough shit. Just remember, speak to your audience.

Since its establishment by¬†[Executive Order](https://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/cftf/execorder.htm)¬†in 2002, the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force has worked hard to hold wrongdoers responsible and to restore an atmosphere of accountability and integrity within corporations across the country. Relying both on traditional investigative techniques and on new tools made available by the Congress at the request of the President, the Task Force has punished corporate malfeasance and encouraged corporate transparency and self-regulation.

The Task Force combines the talents and experience of thousands of investigators, attorneys, accountants, and regulatory experts. Ten federal departments, commissions, and agencies are involved with the Task Force, in addition to seven.

U.S. Attorneys' Offices and two Divisions within the Justice Department. This commitment of resources and expertise reflects the Government's resolve to combat corporate fraud and to foster an environment in which ethical and honest corporate conduct is encouraged and promoted. The Task Force's expanded roster includes the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The new member agencies represent a continuing focus by the Task Force to crack down on mortgage fraud, particularly with regard to ongoing investigations into securitization fraud.

link to this page:¬†<https://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/cftf/membership.htm>¬†- honestly didn't go through and finding direct contacts but I taught you how to fish. For the most part, it seems like this page is old/not updated since 2002 and 2008. So here are three more "Presidential" financial fraud task forces I found.

TLDR 2:¬†HAH, got ya to scroll through the entire DD to try to find the second one. Ok well - above you, there are links to other Government officials and Agencies you can contact about your concerns surrounding the market.¬†God, I wish these Tasks Forces were somehow pro-active, instead of re-active, eh?

and to end... a fun fact about the North District of Illinois (the one with the arrow pointing to it in the picture above) & Shitadel. Did you know... the Mayo Mansion HQ in Chicago is literally right next door to not only to the Federal US District Court (handles federal cases) BUT ALSO the US Bankruptcy court?

Ok well, thats all from me writing a posts at 6:10 am... goodnight.
